A court found the former Sinn Féin leader was defamed in a BBC NI Spotlight programme broadcast in 2016 and an accompanying online article, in which an anonymous contributor alleged he sanctioned the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson. Mr Adams, 76, denies any involvement. He said taking the case ""was about putting manners on the British Broadcasting Corporation"". In a statement on Friday, the Donaldson family called for a public inquiry into the murder, adding they have been ""stonewalled"" while the libel case carried on. The legal bill for the case is believed to be between €3-5 million (£2.5-4.2m), according to sources with knowledge of the case. It is understood to be have been one of the most expensive cases the corporation has ever fought. The head of the BBC in Northern Ireland said the implications of Mr Adams' court win were ""profound"". Adam Smyth, director of BBC NI, said its legal team had warned the jury's decision in the high-profile case could ""hinder freedom of expression"". The trial at the High Court in Dublin heard four weeks of evidence from 10 witnesses, including Mr Adams and BBC NI reporter Jennifer O'Leary. The jury found words used in the programme and accompanying article meant Mr Adams sanctioned and approved Mr Donaldson's murder. They also found the BBC did not report the allegations in good faith and settled on €100,000 in damages. The 11-person jury came to its findings after six hours and 49 minutes of deliberations. Speaking to reporters, Mr Adams thanked the court and said he was ""very mindful"" of the Donaldson family in the course of the trial. ""I know many, many journalists. I like to think that I get on well with most of them and I wish you well and I would uphold your right to do your job,"" he said. ""But the British Broadcasting Corporation upholds the ethos of the British state in Ireland and, in my view, it's out of sync in many, many fronts with the Good Friday Agreement. ""It hasn't caught on to where we are on this island as part of the process, the continuing process, of building peace and justice and harmony and hopefully, in the time ahead, unity."" Mr Adams' solicitor, Paul Tweed, called the allegations against his client ""totally untrue and defamatory"". ""The BBC Spotlight team should not have included it in their broadcast,"" he told reporters. ""Our client is very pleased with this resounding verdict and award of damages which speaks for itself."" The fact the ""false allegation has been left online for nine years"" had ""undermined the high standards of accuracy that is expected at the BBC,"" Mr Tweed said. ""It begs the question whether there has been any political or outside pressure on the BBC to take the stand they have taken."" The BBC had argued a defence of fair and reasonable reporting on a matter of public interest. Speaking outside court, the director of BBC Northern Ireland said he was disappointed. ""We believe we supplied extensive evidence to the court of the careful editorial process and journalistic diligence applied to this programme and accompanying online article,"" said Mr Smyth. ""We didn't want to come to court, but it was important that we defend our journalism and we stand by that decision. ""Of course, a case of this importance, duration and complexity involves significant expense. ""In common with other media organisations the BBC, has insurance and makes financial provision for ongoing and anticipated legal claims."" Denis Donaldson was once a key figure in Sinn Féin's rise as a political force in Northern Ireland. He was found murdered in 2006 after it emerged he had worked for the police and MI5 from inside Sinn Féin for 20 years. In 2009, the Real IRA said it had murdered him. Mr Donaldson's daughter said the murder and surrounding circumstances have ""devastated"" the family. In a statement issued on Friday Jane Donaldson said the family ""supported neither side"" in this case, and she criticised the court for not allowing her to testify. ""The jury heard sensitive, privileged family information tossed around without our consent, but did not hear my testimony,"" she said. She also criticised Mr Adams. ""By reducing events which damaged our lives to a debate about damage to his reputation, the plaintiff has trivialised our family tragedy,"" she said. ""The plaintiff prioritised his own financial and reputational interests over any regard for retraumatising my family."" Mr Adams was the leader of republican party Sinn Féin from 1983 until 2018. He served as MP in his native west Belfast from 1983 to 1992 and again from 1997 until 2011 before sitting as a TD (Teachta Dála) in the Dáil (lower house of Irish parliament) between 2011 and 2020. Mr Adams led the Sinn Féin delegation during peace talks that eventually brought an end to the Troubles after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. He was detained in the early 1970s when the government in Northern Ireland introduced internment without trial for those suspected of paramilitary involvement. Mr Adams has consistently denied being a member of the IRA. Mr Justice Alexander Owens blocked three people appearing as witnesses, including Denis Donaldson's daughter, who the BBC wanted to call to testify. However, the judge ruled what she intended to say was irrelevant in respect of what the jury had to consider. The BBC also wanted to call Austin Stack, whose father Brian, a prison officer, was fatally wounded in an IRA gun attack in Dublin in 1983. It also attempted to call Eunan O'Halpin, a professor of contemporary Irish history at Trinity College, Dublin. BBC NI Spotlight reporter Jennifer O'Leary thanked the legal team involved in ""defending the BBC's journalism"", and the BBC's witnesses in court. ""I said in the witness box that I had nothing to hide, only sources to protect, and I want to thank them for trusting me,"" she said. Jury trials are usually longer – and therefore more expensive – than those held in front of a judge acting alone. The Republic of Ireland is in the process of overhauling its defamation laws, including the elimination of jury trials in High Court defamation cases. In Northern Ireland, there has been ""a presumption against jury trials"" in libel cases since 2022.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqg138lzr3o,real

Images posted on theelusive artist's Instagram depict a lighthouse stencilled on a drab, beige wall, along with the words: ""I want to be what you saw in me."" A false shadow appears to have been drawn on the pavement from a nearby bollard, giving the illusion that the lighthouse is itself a silhouette of the mundane street furniture. Its location was initially a mystery, but BBC Verify has confirmed it as Rue Félix Fregier in the southern French city. An image of the art circulating online shows a blurred person riding a scooter in front of the piece, with a graffiti tag seemingly reading ""Yaze"" further along the wall. The tag matches that used by a Canadian graffiti artist Marco The Polo, whose Instagram account features photos of his own work but who has called Banksy an inspiration. Banksy has kept his true identity a secret throughout his career, and it is only through the Instagram account that works are identified as genuine. Often imbuing his works with a political message, his previous pieces have alluded to immigration, the war in Ukraine and homelessness, among other things. The meaning of some of his works, though, is less clear - such as his motivation behindthe series of animals painted in various locations across Londonlast summer.

His death was confirmed by FBI Director Kash Patel, who said the former police officer died Thursday after a ""private battle with illness."" Kerik oversaw the police response to the deadliest terrorist attack in US history, and was later appointed by former US President George Bush as head of a provisional police force in Iraq. He pleaded guilty to charges of tax fraud in 2009 and served three years in prison, though he was pardoned by President Donald Trump in 2020. Those who paid tribute to Kerik include former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was in office when Kerik served as commissioner of the NYPD, and current mayor Eric Adams. ""We've been together since the beginning. He's like my brother,"" Giuiliani said Thursday on his show. ""I was a better man for having known Bernie,"" Giuiliani said. ""I certainly was a braver and stronger man."" Adams, who had been friends with Kerik for nearly 30 years, said he had visited him in hospital before his death. ""He was with his loved ones who are in my prayers tonight,"" Adams said in a statement. ""He was a great New Yorker and American."" Kerik, a former army veteran and a decorated law enforcement officer, rose up the ranks through his career, and was nearly tapped to run the Department of Homeland Security under Bush in 2004 before he abruptly withdrew his nomination. In 2009, Kerik pleaded guilty to federal charges after he was accused of lying to investigators about interest-free loans he received from an Israeli billionaire and a New York real estate magnet while he was in public office. He was granted a full pardon by Trump in 2020, and later joined Giuiliani's efforts to overturn Trump's election loss that same year.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74qwj1wv34o,real

""All of the music I've ever made now belongs to me,"" said the star, announcing the news on her official website. ""I've been bursting into tears of joy... ever since I found out this is really happening."" The saga began in June 2019, when music manager Scooter Braun bought Swift's former record label Big Machine and, with it, all of the songs from Taylor Swift, Fearless, ...","Taylor Swift has bought back the rights to her first six albums, ending a long-running battle over the ownership of her music. ""All of the music I've ever made now belongs to me,"" said the star, announcing the news on her official website. ""I've been bursting into tears of joy... ever since I found out this is really happening."" The saga began in June 2019, when music manager Scooter Braun bought Swift's former record label Big Machine and, with it, all of the songs from Taylor Swift, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989 and Reputation. Swift had personal objections to the deal, blaming Braun for complicity in the ""incessant, manipulative bullying"" against her by Kanye West, one of his clients. On her website, Swift said that reclaiming the rights to her music had, for a long time, seemed unimaginable. ""To say this is my greatest dream come true is actually being pretty reserved about it,"" she added, thanking fans for their support as the drama played out. ""I can't thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but have never owned until now. ""I almost stopped thinking it could ever happen, after 20 years of having the carrot dangled and then yanked away,"" she wrote. ""But that's all in the past now."" In the music industry, the owner of a master recording controls the way it is distributed and licenced. The artist still earns royalties, but controlling the masters offers protection over how the work is used in future. Swift responded by vowing to re-record those records, effectively diminishing the value of those master tapes, and putting ownership back in her hands. To date, she has released four re-recorded albums - known as ""Taylor's Versions"" - with dozens of bonus tracks and supplementary material. In her letter, the star told fans she had yet to complete the project, after ""hitting a stopping point"" while trying to remake 2017's Reputation album - which dealt with public scrutiny of her private life, and the fall-out of her feud with Kanye West. ""The Reputation album was so specific to that time in my life,"" she explained. ""All that defiance, that longing to be understood while feeling purposefully misunderstood... ""To be perfectly honest, it's the one album in those first six that I thought couldn't be improved by re-doing it... so I kept putting it off."" Last week, the star previewed the new version of Reputation's first single, Look What You Made Me Do, in an episode of The Handmaid's Tale - but her letter suggested that a full re-recording would be delayed or even scrapped. However, she promised that vault tracks from the record would be released at a future date, if fans were ""into the idea"". She also confirmed that she had re-recorded her self-titled debut, adding: ""I really love how it sounds now"". ""Those two albums can still have their moments to re-emerge when the time is right,"" she added. ""But if it happens, it won't be from a place of sadness and longing for what I wish I could have. It will just be a celebration now."" In the music industry, the owner of a master controls all rights to exploit the recording. That includes distributing music to streaming services, pressing new physical CDs and vinyl, creating box sets, or licensing songs to movies or video games. The artist still earns royalties from those recordings but controlling the master offers a level of protection over how the work is used in the future. Swift, as the writer or co-writer of her music, always maintained her publishing rights, which meant she was able to veto attempts to license songs like Shake It Off and Love Story to other companies. ""I do want my music to live on. I do want it to be in movies. I do want it to be in commercials. But I only want that if I own it,"" she told Billboard in 2019. It is not known how much it cost Swift to acquire her masters, but the catalogue previously sold for $300 million (£222 million) in 2020. The BBC understands that rumours she paid between $600 million to $1 billion are inaccurately high. When 14-year-old Taylor Swift moved to Nashville in 2004 to chase her dream of becoming a country pop star, she signed a record deal with Big Machine. Label boss Scott Borchetta gave the unproven singer a big cash advance in exchange for having ownership of the master recordings to her first six albums ""in perpetuity"". This was fairly common practice in the era before streaming, when artists needed record label backing to get played on the radio, and for the manufacture and distribution of CDs. Swift's deal with Big Machine expired in 2018, at which point she left and signed with Republic Records and Universal Music Group (UMG). A year later, Borchetta sold his label to Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings. Swift said she only learned about the deal when it was announced; characterising it as an act of aggression that ""stripped me of my life's work"". She labelled Braun - who rose to prominence as the manager of Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande - as ""the definition of toxic male privilege in our industry"". She also expressed frustration that she had been unable to make a counter offer for her music. ""I spent 10 years of my life trying rigorously to purchase my masters outright and was then denied that opportunity,""she told Billboard, adding that: ""Artists should maybe have the first right of refusal to buy."" Braun later told Variety that the dispute had ""gotten out of hand"" after he and his family received death threats. The music mogul later sold his stake in Swift's back catalogue to Shamrock Holdings, a Los Angeles investment fund founded by the Disney family in 1978, in November 2020. The multi-million dollar deal left Swift feeling betrayed again. ""This is the second time my music had been sold without my knowledge,"" she said in a social media post. While she was ""open to the possibility of a partnership with Shamrock"", she subsequently learnt that, under the terms of the sale, Braun would ""continue to profit off my old music"" for years. ""I simply cannot in good conscience bring myself to be involved in benefiting Scooter Braun's interests,"" she wrote in a letter to the company, which she posted on X. She began releasing her re-recorded albums in 2021, starting with her breakthrough, coming-of-age album Fearless. Produced with forensic attention to detail, they were often indistinguishable from the originals - albeit with slightly cleaner mixes, and greater separation between the instruments. But the big attraction was the bonus tracks, including the unabridged, 10-minute version of her break-up ballad All Too Well - described by Variety magazine as the ""holy grail"" of the star's back catalogue. The song went on to top the US charts, and made number three in the UK - where it is the longest song ever to reach the top five. In the meantime, the singer continued to release original material, including the Grammy Award-winning albums Folklore and Midnights. In 2023, Forbes magazine reported that Swift had become the first musician to make $1 billion (£740 million) solely from songwriting and performing. Half of her fortune came from music royalties and touring, while the rest came from the increasing value of her music catalogue, including her re-recordings. Revisiting the old material also inspired Swift's career-spanning Eras tour, which made more than $2 billion (£1.48 billion) in ticket sales across 2023 and 2024. In her letter, Swift said the success of the Eras tour ""is why I was able to buy back my music"". She added that she was heartened to see her struggle inspiring other artists. ""Every time a new artist tells me they negotiated to own their master recordings in their record contract because of this fight, I'm reminded of how important it was for all of this to happen. ""Thank you being curious about something that used to be thought of as too industry-centric for broad discussion. ""You'll never know how much it means to me that you cared. Every single bit of it counted, and ended us up here."" Hull City Council hopes to submit another bid in 2027 to become a City of Music.

Regional police commissioner Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi said that at the time of the suspect's death, he had 28 ID cards and a dozen mobile phones in his possession. After hearing of the fatal shootout, Chriselda Kananda, a spokesperson for Ms Mongale's family, told South African broadcaster SABC News: ""It is quite a relief for the family that justice for Olorato, before we even lay her body to rest, would have been served."" Ms Mongale's death has sparked a fierce debate about the levels of violence faced by women in South Africa. The country has one of the highest rates of femicide and gender-based violence in the world. In an impassioned statement, Police Minister Senzo Mchunu called Ms Mongale's killing ""inhumane"" and ""gruesome"", adding: ""To all men, this is a plea - simple, urgent, and human: Please, stop killing women."" While continuing the search for two other men allegedly linked to the murder, the police took the parents of the deceased suspect into custody. The suspect's mother is accused of enabling him to ""evade arrest"" by tipping him off about the police's presence at her house. The police also said the suspect's father is the owner of a VW Polo allegedly used in Ms Mongale's murder. The vehicle, which has been seized by the police, had traces of blood inside it, Brig Mathe said. The suspect's parents were questioned in custody but have now been released, said commissioner Mkhwanazi. Earlier this week, the police named the three suspects linked to the killing as Fezile Ngubane, Philangenkosi Sibongokuhle Makhanya and Bongani Mthimkhulu. Two of them - Mr Makhanya and Mr Mthimkhulu - were last month arrested for kidnapping and robbing a woman in KwaZulu-Natal, using the same VW Polo involved in Ms Mongale's murder, police said. Both men had been freed on bail. As part of their investigation into the killing, the police have identified a criminal gang or ""syndicate"" who have been targeting women in malls ""for kidnapping and robbery"", said police spokesperson Mathe. ""They propose them, request to take them out on a date. When they agree, that is when they plan to rob them,"" she added. When Ms Mongale was last seen on Sunday, she was on a date with a man she had met a few days earlier at a shopping centre. CCTV footage showed her leaving a location in Kew, Johannesburg, and walking towards a white VW Polo with fake licence plates. The 30-year-old's friends said she was invited for a date by a man only identified as John, who she had met in Johannesburg, where she was studying for a postgraduate degree at Witwatersrand University. She texted one of her friends shortly before leaving home, saying that she was excited and getting ready for her date. But police later found her body in an open field, sparking public outrage and calls for justice. The family spokesperson said Ms Mongale's body had been ""brutally violated"". A candlelight vigil was held on Wednesday evening in Lombardy West, at the site where her body was found. Family and friends have described her as an outspoken, bubbly woman who ""lived with purpose and love"", local media reported. Go toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.

And that means flexing its muscles to rid the seas around East and South East Asia of their US military presence, so it can dominate the shipping lanes so vital for global trade. By building up its nuclear and conventional arsenals, China aims to show the US that times have changed and that it's too dangerous a power to challenge. The US has long had the upper hand in the Asia-Pacific - with tens of thousands of troops based in Japan and South Korea, alongside several military bases. Trump's administration has clearly focused its energy on countering China - by initiating a trade war and seeking to strengthen alliances with Asian nations. The Shangri-La Dialogue has historically been the setting for top-level encounters between the US and China – an arena for the superpowers to set out their vision for security in the region. And it's opening again in Singapore on Friday. Here's what we can expect from the three-day event: The growing struggle for dominance between the US and China is undoubtedly the biggest issue in Asia-Pacific security. Gone are the days when China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) was characterised by outdated weaponry and rigid Maoist doctrine. Today it is a formidable force deploying state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles and fifth-generation warplanes like the J20. Its navy has the largest number of warships in the world, outstripping the United States. While China lags far behind the US and Russia in its number of nuclear warheads, it is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal, with missiles that can travel up to 15,000km, putting the continental US easily within range. The US Navy's formidable 7th Fleet, based in Yokosuka, just south of Tokyo, can no longer claim to have guaranteed naval supremacy in the region. China's array of Dong Feng missiles and swarms of explosive drones would make any approach to its shores extremely hazardous for US warships. Ultimately, Beijing is believed to be working to ""push"" the US military out of the western Pacific. Taiwan is a liberal, self-governing, pro-Western island democracy that China's President Xi Jinping has vowed to ""take back"" by force if necessary. It has an economic importance well beyond its geographic small size. It manufactures more than 90% of the world's high-end microchips, the all-important semi-conductors that power so much of our tech. Recent opinion polls have made clear that a majority of Taiwanese people do not want to be ruled by Beijing, but Xi has made this a key policy aim. The US has done much to help Taiwan bolster its defences but the key question of whether Washington would go to war with China over Taiwan has always been shrouded in something called ""strategic ambiguity"", i.e. keeping Beijing guessing. On more than one occasion President Biden indicated the US would respond militarily in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan. But the return of Donald Trump to the Oval Office has brought back a degree of uncertainty. There are also major concerns in the region over China's attempts to turn the entire South China Sea into what some have called a ""Chinese lake"". The PLA Navy has established military bases on reefs, many artificially dredged, across the strategically important South China Sea, an area through which an estimated $3 trillion's worth of maritime trade passes annually. Today China deploys a vast, industrial fishing fleet across the South China Sea, backed by its fleet of coastguard ships and warships. These vessels clash frequently with Filipino fishermen, fishing close to their own country's shores. China frequently challenges planes and ships transiting the South China Sea, warning them they are entering Chinese territory without permission, when the rest of the world considers this to be international waters. Donald Trump, when asked during his first presidency if North Korea could ever develop nuclear missiles that could reach the continental United States, vowed ""it's never going to happen"". But it has. In what amounts to a serious CIA intelligence failure, Pyongyang has demonstrated that it now possesses both the nuclear know-how and the means to deliver those warheads across the Pacific Ocean. Successive US presidencies have failed to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions and this isolated, economically backward yet militarily powerful nation is thought to have at least 20 nuclear warheads. It also has an enormous, well-armed army, some of which its autocratic leader Kim Jong Un has sent to help Russia fight Ukraine. Defence analysts are still dissecting the recent, brief but alarming conflict between these two nuclear-armed neighbours. India's military far outnumbers Pakistan's and yet the latter was allegedly able to land an embarrassing blow against India's air force, when Pakistan's Chinese-made J10-C jets went up against India's advanced, French-made Rafales. Pakistan reportedly shot down at least one of the Indian warplanes, using Chinese-made PL-15 air-to-air missiles. The reports were denied in India's media. China's assistance to Pakistan in the conflict has reportedly been critical to Islamabad, including repositioning its satellites to provide it with real-time intelligence. Both India and Pakistan are expected to make high-level addresses at the Shangri-La Dialogue this weekend while the US and others will be looking for ways to prevent a repeat of their clash over Kashmir. All of this is happening in a dramatically changed US context. Donald Trump's sudden imposition of trade tariffs, while eventually modified, has caused many in the region to rethink their reliance on Washington. Would an ally that is prepared to inflict so much economic pain on its friends really come to their aid if they were attacked? China has been quick to capitalise on the confusion. It reached out to neighbours such as Vietnam - a country it went to war with in 1979 - to point out the People's Republic represented stability and continuity in an unstable world. Under the previous US administration, Washington signed up to a multi-billion dollar trilateral partnership between the US, UK and Australia under the acronym of Aukus. It aims to not only build Canberra's next generation of submarines but to guarantee freedom of navigation across the South China Sea using intelligence and naval force deployed by the three nations. President Trump, when asked in February about his commitment to the Aukus pact, appeared not to recognise the term, asking in reply: ""What does that mean?"" But early this Saturday morning the US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth will be addressing the Shangri-La Dialogue, potentially offering some clarity on Aukus as well as how the US plans to work with, and quite possibly against, China's interests across the Asia-Pacific region. The remarks from both sides raise concerns that a trade war could erupt again between the two largest economies.

A court found the former Sinn Féin leader was defamed in a BBC NI Spotlight programme broadcast in 2016 and an accompanying online article, in which an anonymous contributor alleged he sanctioned the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson. Mr Adams, 76, denies any involvement. He said taking the case ""was about putting manners on the British Broadcasting Corporation"". In a statement on Friday, the Donaldson family called for a public inquiry into the murder, adding they have been ""stonewalled"" while the libel case carried on. The legal bill for the case is believed to be between €3-5 million (£2.5-4.2m), according to sources with knowledge of the case. It is understood to have been one of the most expensive cases the corporation has ever fought. The head of the BBC in Northern Ireland said the implications of Mr Adams' court win were ""profound"". Adam Smyth, director of BBC NI, said its legal team had warned the jury's decision in the high-profile case could ""hinder freedom of expression"". The trial at the High Court in Dublin heard four weeks of evidence from 10 witnesses, including Mr Adams and BBC NI reporter Jennifer O'Leary. The jury found words used in the programme and accompanying article meant Mr Adams sanctioned and approved Mr Donaldson's murder. They also found the BBC did not report the allegations in good faith and settled on €100,000 in damages. The 11-person jury came to its findings after six hours and 49 minutes of deliberations. Speaking to reporters, Mr Adams thanked the court and said he was ""very mindful"" of the Donaldson family in the course of the trial. ""I know many, many journalists. I like to think that I get on well with most of them and I wish you well and I would uphold your right to do your job,"" he said. ""But the British Broadcasting Corporation upholds the ethos of the British state in Ireland and, in my view, it's out of sync in many, many fronts with the Good Friday Agreement. ""It hasn't caught on to where we are on this island as part of the process, the continuing process, of building peace and justice and harmony and hopefully, in the time ahead, unity."" Mr Adams' solicitor, Paul Tweed, called the allegations against his client ""totally untrue and defamatory"". ""The BBC Spotlight team should not have included it in their broadcast,"" he told reporters. ""Our client is very pleased with this resounding verdict and award of damages which speaks for itself."" The fact the ""false allegation has been left online for nine years"" had ""undermined the high standards of accuracy that is expected at the BBC,"" Mr Tweed said. ""It begs the question whether there has been any political or outside pressure on the BBC to take the stand they have taken."" The BBC had argued a defence of fair and reasonable reporting on a matter of public interest. Speaking outside court, the director of BBC Northern Ireland said he was disappointed. ""We believe we supplied extensive evidence to the court of the careful editorial process and journalistic diligence applied to this programme and accompanying online article,"" said Mr Smyth. ""We didn't want to come to court, but it was important that we defend our journalism and we stand by that decision. ""Of course, a case of this importance, duration and complexity involves significant expense. ""In common with other media organisations the BBC, has insurance and makes financial provision for ongoing and anticipated legal claims."" BBC NI Spotlight reporter Jennifer O'Leary thanked the legal team involved in ""defending the BBC's journalism"", and the BBC's witnesses in court. ""I said in the witness box that I had nothing to hide, only sources to protect, and I want to thank them for trusting me,"" she said. Mr Justice Alexander Owens blocked three people appearing as witnesses, including Denis Donaldson's daughter, who the BBC wanted to call to testify. However, the judge ruled what she intended to say was irrelevant in respect of what the jury had to consider. The BBC also wanted to call Austin Stack, whose father Brian, a prison officer, was fatally wounded in an IRA gun attack in Dublin in 1983. It also attempted to call Eunan O'Halpin, a professor of contemporary Irish history at Trinity College, Dublin. Denis Donaldson was once a key figure in Sinn Féin's rise as a political force in Northern Ireland. He was found murdered in 2006 after it emerged he had worked for the police and MI5 from inside Sinn Féin for 20 years. In 2009, the Real IRA said it had murdered him. Mr Donaldson's daughter said the murder and surrounding circumstances have ""devastated"" the family. In a statement issued on Friday Jane Donaldson said the family ""supported neither side"" in this case, and she criticised the court for not allowing her to testify. ""The jury heard sensitive, privileged family information tossed around without our consent, but did not hear my testimony,"" she said. She also criticised Mr Adams. ""By reducing events which damaged our lives to a debate about damage to his reputation, the plaintiff has trivialised our family tragedy,"" she said. ""The plaintiff prioritised his own financial and reputational interests over any regard for retraumatising my family."" Mr Adams was the leader of republican party Sinn Féin from 1983 until 2018. He served as MP in his native west Belfast from 1983 to 1992 and again from 1997 until 2011 before sitting as a TD (Teachta Dála) in the Dáil (lower house of Irish parliament) between 2011 and 2020. Mr Adams led the Sinn Féin delegation during peace talks that eventually brought an end to the Troubles after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. He was detained in the early 1970s when the government in Northern Ireland introduced internment without trial for those suspected of paramilitary involvement. Mr Adams has consistently denied being a member of the IRA. Jury trials are usually longer – and therefore more expensive – than those held in front of a judge acting alone. The Republic of Ireland is in the process of overhauling its defamation laws, including the elimination of jury trials in High Court defamation cases. In Northern Ireland, there has been ""a presumption against jury trials"" in libel cases since 2022.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqg138lzr3o,real

The ruling put on hold a previous federal judge's order stopping the administration from ending the ""parole"" immigration programme, established by former President Joe Biden. The programme protected immigrants fleeing economic and political turmoil in their home countries. The new order puts roughly 530,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela at risk of being deported. Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor, two of the court's three liberal justices, dissented. The parole programme allows immigrants temporary status to work and live in the US for two years because of ""urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit"", according to the US government. The Trump administration had filed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court after a federal judge in Massachusetts blocked the administration from ending the programme, also known as CHNV humanitarian parole. The White House ""celebrated"" the opportunity to deport 500,000 ""invaders"", White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller told CNN. ""The Supreme Court justly stepped in"". In her dissent, Justice Jackson wrote that the court's order would ""have the lives of half a million migrants unravel all around us before the courts decide their legal claims"". On the day he took office, Trump signed an executive order directing the Department of Homeland Security to get rid of parole programmes. Then, in March, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the end of CHNV humanitarian parole. Several immigrants rights groups and migrants from the programme sued the Trump administration over the decision, arguing they could ""face serious risks of danger, persecution and even death"" if deported back to their home countries. The ruling comes after the Supreme Court earlier this month allowed Trump officials to revoke Temporary Protected Status (TPS) - a separate programme - for some 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants living and working in the US. Humanitarian parole programmes have been used for decades to allow immigrants fleeing war and other tumultuous conditions in their home countries to come to the US, including Cubans in the 1960s following the revolution. The Biden administration also established a parole programme in 2022 for Ukrainians fleeing after Russia's invasion.

However, growth for full 2024-25 year, which runs between April and March, is pegged at 6.5% - the slowest in four years. The country's central bank - the Reserve Bank of India - meets later in June and is expected to cut rates for the third time in a row to boost growth. India remains the world's fastest growing major economy, although growth has sharply dropped from the 9.2% high recorded in financial year 2023-24. Asia's third-largest economy benefitted from strong farm activity, steady public spending and improved rural demand in the last financial year, even as manufacturing and new investments by private companies remained weak. While rural growth has improved on account of a strong winter harvest, it is not nearly enough to offset continuing weakness in urban consumption, which has flagged due to high unemployment and lower wages. India's growth engine remains heavily dependent on the government's infrastructure spending on roads, ports and highways, in the absence of significant improvement in private investment. Going forward, domestic growth should benefit from government's income tax cuts announced in the federal budget, as well as ""monetary easing, expectations of an above normal monsoon and lower food inflation"", Aditi Nayar, an economist with the ratings agency Icra, said. But ongoing global uncertainties, including US President Donald Trump's trade war, are expected to weigh on export demand. India is currently negotiating a trade-agreement with the United States which is officially expected to conclude by fall. Trump slapped tariffs of up to 27% on Indian goods in April – and a 90-day pause on these ends on 9 July. Economists expect GDP growth in the ongoing financial year 2025-26  to further slow to 6% on the back of these global slowdown worries which could delay new private capital spending on projects. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects global growth to drop to 2.8% in 2025 and 3% in 2026. Data from Icra earlier showed private sector expenditure, as part of overall investments in India's economy, fell to a 10-year low of 33% in the last financial year. Net foreign direct investment (FDI) into India – at $0.35bn in 2024-25 – also fell to the lowest level in two decades, as rising outward foreign investment and repatriations by Indian companies, neutralised inward investment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has been attempting to position India as a manufacturing hub for global companies. While companies like Apple indicated recently that it was shifting most of its production of iPhones headed to the US from China to India, trade analysts have cautioned that suchmanufacturing investment could yet stall, with the US and China agreeing to roll-back tariffs earlier this month.

And that means flexing its muscles to rid the seas around East and South East Asia of their US military presence, so it can dominate the shipping lanes so vital for global trade. By building up its nuclear and conventional arsenals, China aims to show the US that times have changed and that it's too dangerous a power to challenge. The US has long had the upper hand in the Asia-Pacific - with tens of thousands of troops based in Japan and South Korea, alongside several military bases. Trump's administration has clearly focused its energy on countering China - by initiating a trade war and seeking to strengthen alliances with Asian nations. The Shangri-La Dialogue has historically been the setting for top-level encounters between the US and China – an arena for the superpowers to set out their vision for security in the region. And it's opening again in Singapore on Friday. Here's what we can expect from the three-day event: The growing struggle for dominance between the US and China is undoubtedly the biggest issue in Asia-Pacific security. Gone are the days when China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) was characterised by outdated weaponry and rigid Maoist doctrine. Today it is a formidable force deploying state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles and fifth-generation warplanes like the J20. Its navy has the largest number of warships in the world, outstripping the United States. While China lags far behind the US and Russia in its number of nuclear warheads, it is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal, with missiles that can travel up to 15,000km, putting the continental US easily within range. The US Navy's formidable 7th Fleet, based in Yokosuka, just south of Tokyo, can no longer claim to have guaranteed naval supremacy in the region. China's array of Dong Feng missiles and swarms of explosive drones would make any approach to its shores extremely hazardous for US warships. Ultimately, Beijing is believed to be working to ""push"" the US military out of the western Pacific. Taiwan is a liberal, self-governing, pro-Western island democracy that China's President Xi Jinping has vowed to ""take back"" by force if necessary. It has an economic importance well beyond its geographic small size. It manufactures more than 90% of the world's high-end microchips, the all-important semi-conductors that power so much of our tech. Recent opinion polls have made clear that a majority of Taiwanese people do not want to be ruled by Beijing, but Xi has made this a key policy aim. The US has done much to help Taiwan bolster its defences but the key question of whether Washington would go to war with China over Taiwan has always been shrouded in something called ""strategic ambiguity"", i.e. keeping Beijing guessing. On more than one occasion President Biden indicated the US would respond militarily in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan. But the return of Donald Trump to the Oval Office has brought back a degree of uncertainty. There are also major concerns in the region over China's attempts to turn the entire South China Sea into what some have called a ""Chinese lake"". The PLA Navy has established military bases on reefs, many artificially dredged, across the strategically important South China Sea, an area through which an estimated $3 trillion's worth of maritime trade passes annually. Today China deploys a vast, industrial fishing fleet across the South China Sea, backed by its fleet of coastguard ships and warships. These vessels clash frequently with Filipino fishermen, fishing close to their own country's shores. China frequently challenges planes and ships transiting the South China Sea, warning them they are entering Chinese territory without permission, when the rest of the world considers this to be international waters. Donald Trump, when asked during his first presidency if North Korea could ever develop nuclear missiles that could reach the continental United States, vowed ""it's never going to happen"". But it has. In what amounts to a serious CIA intelligence failure, Pyongyang has demonstrated that it now possesses both the nuclear know-how and the means to deliver those warheads across the Pacific Ocean. Successive US presidencies have failed to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions and this isolated, economically backward yet militarily powerful nation is thought to have at least 20 nuclear warheads. It also has an enormous, well-armed army, some of which its autocratic leader Kim Jong Un has sent to help Russia fight Ukraine. Defence analysts are still dissecting the recent, brief but alarming conflict between these two nuclear-armed neighbours. India's military far outnumbers Pakistan's and yet the latter was allegedly able to land an embarrassing blow against India's air force, when Pakistan's Chinese-made J10-C jets went up against India's advanced, French-made Rafales. Pakistan reportedly shot down at least one of the Indian warplanes, using Chinese-made PL-15 air-to-air missiles. The reports were denied in India's media. China's assistance to Pakistan in the conflict has reportedly been critical to Islamabad, including repositioning its satellites to provide it with real-time intelligence. Both India and Pakistan are expected to make high-level addresses at the Shangri-La Dialogue this weekend while the US and others will be looking for ways to prevent a repeat of their clash over Kashmir. All of this is happening in a dramatically changed US context. Donald Trump's sudden imposition of trade tariffs, while eventually modified, has caused many in the region to rethink their reliance on Washington. Would an ally that is prepared to inflict so much economic pain on its friends really come to their aid if they were attacked? China has been quick to capitalise on the confusion. It reached out to neighbours such as Vietnam - a country it went to war with in 1979 - to point out the People's Republic represented stability and continuity in an unstable world. Under the previous US administration, Washington signed up to a multi-billion dollar trilateral partnership between the US, UK and Australia under the acronym of Aukus. It aims to not only build Canberra's next generation of submarines but to guarantee freedom of navigation across the South China Sea using intelligence and naval force deployed by the three nations. President Trump, when asked in February about his commitment to the Aukus pact, appeared not to recognise the term, asking in reply: ""What does that mean?"" But early this Saturday morning the US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth will be addressing the Shangri-La Dialogue, potentially offering some clarity on Aukus as well as how the US plans to work with, and quite possibly against, China's interests across the Asia-Pacific region. The remarks from both sides raise concerns that a trade war could erupt again between the two largest economies.

Earlier this week, the South African-born billionaire, on his social media platform, X, thanked President Trump for histime at the Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge. Trump announced he will host a news conference in the Oval Office on Friday with Musk, writing: ""This will be his last day, but not really, because he will, always, be with us, helping all the way."" While Musk's time in government lasted little more than four months, his work with Doge upended the federal government and had an impact not just in the halls of power in Washington - but around the world. Let's take a look at some of the ways Musk has left a mark. Musk took a job with the Trump White House with one mission: to cut spending from the government as much as possible. He began with an initial target of ""at least $2 trillion"", which then shifted to $1tn and ultimately $150bn. To date, Doge claims to have saved $175bn through a combination of asset sales, lease and grant cancellations, ""fraud and improper payment deletion"", regulatory savings and a 260,000-person reduction from the 2.3 million-strong federal workforce. ABBC analysis of those figures,however, found that evidence is sometimes lacking. This mission has at times caused both chaos and controversy, including some instances in which federal judges halted mass firings and ordered employees reinstated. In other instances, the administration has been forced to backtrack on firings. In one notable instance in February, the administration stopped the firing of hundreds of federal employees working at the National Nuclear Security Administration, including some with sensitive jobs related to the US nuclear arsenal. Musk himself repeatedly acknowledged that mass firings would inevitably include mistakes. ""We will make mistakes,"" he said in February, after his department mistook a region of Mozambique for Hamas-controlled Gaza while cutting an aid programme. ""But we'll act quickly to correct any mistakes."" Doge's efforts to access data also garnered controversy, particularly the department's push for access to sensitive treasury department systems that control the private information of millions of Americans. Polls show that cuts to government spending remain popular with many Americans - even if Musk's personal popularity has waned. The presence of Musk - an unelected ""special government employee"" with companies that count the US government as customers - in Trump's White House has also raised eyebrows, prompting questions about potential conflicts of interest. His corporate empire includes large companies that do business with US and foreign governments. SpaceX has $22 billion in US government contracts, according to the company's chief executive. Some Democrats also accused Musk of taking advantage of his position to drum up business abroad for his satellite internet services firm, Starlink. The White House was accused of helping Musk's businesses by showcasing vehicles made by Tesla - his embattled car company - on the White House lawn in March. Musk and Trump have both shrugged off any suggestion that his work with the government is conflicted or ethically problematic. Around the world, Musk's work with Doge was most felt after the vast majority - over 80% - of the US Agency for International Development's (USAID's) programmes were eliminated following a six-week review by Doge. The rest were absorbed by the State Department. The Musk and Doge-led cuts formed part of a wider effort by the Trump administration to bring overseas spending closer in line with its ""America First"" approach. The cuts to the agency - tasked with work such as famine detection, vaccinations and food aid in conflict areas - quickly had an impact on projects includingcommunal kitchens in war-torn Sudan, scholarshipsfor young Afghan womenwho fled the Taliban and clinicsfor transgender people in India. USAID also was a crucial instrument of US ""soft power"" around the world, leading some detractors pointing to its elimination as a sign of waning American influence on the global stage. While Musk - and Trump - have for years been accused by detractors of spreading baseless conspiracy theories, Musk's presence in the White House starkly highlighted how misinformation has crept into discourse at the highest levels of the US government. For example, Musk spread an unfounded internet theory that US gold reserves had quietly been stolen from Fort Knox in Kentucky. At one point, he floated the idea of livestreaming a visit there to ensure the gold was secured. More recently,Musk spread widely discredited rumours that the white Afrikaner population of South Africa is facing ""genocide"" in their home country. Those rumours found their way into the Oval Office earlier in May, when a meeting aimed at soothing tensions between the US and South Africa took a drastic twist after Trump presented South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with videos and articles he said were evidence of crimes against Afrikaners. Musk's work in government also showed that, despite public pledges of unity, there are tensions within the ""Trump 2.0"" administration. While Trump publicly - and repeatedly - backed the work of Musk and Doge, Musk's tenure was marked by reports of tension between him and members of the cabinet who felt Doge cuts were impacting their agencies. ""They have a lot of respect for Elon and that he's doing this, and some disagree a little bit,"" Trump acknowledged in a February cabinet meeting. ""If they aren't, I want them to speak up."" At one point, he was asked whether any cabinet members had expressed dissatisfaction with Musk and turned to the room to ask them. No one spoke. The announcement of Musk's departure also came the same day that CBS - the BBC's US partner - publicised part of an interview during which Musk said he was""disappointed"" by Trump's ""big, beautiful"" budget bill.The bill includes multi-trillion dollar tax breaks and a pledge to increase defence spending. Musk said the bill ""undermines"" the work of Doge to cut spending - reflecting larger tensions within the Republican Party over the path forward.

Washington and Beijing agreed to temporarily lower tit-for-tat tariffs after talks in Geneva earlier this month. But Trump said on Friday that China had ""totally violated its agreement with us"". He did not give details but US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer later said China had not been removing non-tariff barriers as agreed under the deal. Beijing's response on Friday did not address the US claims directly but urged the US to ""cease discriminatory restrictions against China"". The strong statements from both sides have raised concerns that trade tensions could again escalate between the world's two largest economies despite recent negotiations. Trump on Friday said in a Truth Social post that the tariffs his administration had imposed had been ""devastating"" for China and so he had ""made a FAST DEAL"" to save them from ""what I thought was going to be a very bad situation"". ""Everybody was happy! That is the good news!!! The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!"" He did not expand on his accusation, but Ambassador Greer later told TV network CNBC that China was yet to properly roll back other trade restrictions it had levied on the US. Greer said when China responded to the US's tariffs with its own, they also put in place countermeasures such as putting some US companies on blacklists and restricting exports of rare earth magnets, a critical component in cars, aircraft and semiconductors. ""They removed the tariff like we did but some of the countermeasures they've slowed on,"" Ambassador Greer said. He added the US had been closely watching China to make sure it would comply with the deal and they were ""very concerned"" with the progress. ""The United States did exactly what it was supposed to do and the Chinese are slow-rolling their compliance which is completely unacceptable and has to be addressed,"" Greer said. China responded on Friday urging the US to ""immediately correct its erroneous actions, cease discriminatory restrictions against China and jointly uphold the consensus reached at the high-level talks in Geneva"". A spokesman from its Washington embassy said China had recently ""repeatedly raised concerns"" with the US over its ""abuse of export control measures in the semiconductor sector"". The US already has restrictions in place on technology exports to China, and on Wednesday paused more sales to China of chip technologies - crucial to semiconductors - and also paused exports of chemicals and machinery. Pengyu Liu said both sides had maintained communication since the talks in  Geneva on 11 May, which had ended on a positive note. However on Thursday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had said trade talks with China had become ""a bit stalled"". Bessent told Fox News on Thursday: ""I think that given the magnitude of the talks, given the complexity, that this is going to require [leaders of both the countries] to weigh in with each other."" Trump's global tariff regime was dealt a blow on Wednesday following a ruling that he had exceeded his authority. His plans have been temporarily reinstated after the White House appealed the decision. His administration this week also moved to ""aggressively"" revoke the visas of Chinese students studying in the US, of which there are an estimated 280,000. In Geneva, Washington and Beijing had agreed to reduce tariffs imposed on each other's imports in a deal where both nations cancelled some tariffs altogether and suspended others for 90 days. Bessent said talks on a further deal had lost momentum, but stressed they were continuing. ""I believe that we will be having more talks with [China] in the next few weeks and I believe we may at some point have a call between the president and [Chinese President Xi Jinping],"" Bessent said on Thursday. He added the pair had ""a very good relationship"" and he was ""confident that the Chinese will come to the table when President Trump makes his preferences known"". Underthe deal struck earlier this month, the US lowered tariffs imposed on goods from China from 145% to 30%. China's retaliatory tariffs on US goods dropped from 125% to 10%. The US President has argued imposing tariffs on foreign goods would encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, bringing back manufacturing jobs while increasing the amount of tax revenue raised. They have been used by the Trump administration as leverage in negotiations as it seeks to reduce trade deficits with other nations. A delegation from Japan are continuing trade talks with their US counterparts in Washington on Friday. Bessent said ""a couple"" of US trade deals were ""very close"", but ""a couple of them are more complicated"". Trump's tariff regime remains in the balance following the decision by the US Court of International Trade, which ruled that Trump hadoverstepped his power by imposing the duties. Some analysts believe it will mean countries will be less likely to rush to secure trade deals with the US. A federal appeals court has granted a bid from the White House to temporarily suspend the lower court's order, which Trump described as ""horrific"". ""Hopefully, the Supreme Court will reverse this horrible, Country [sic] threatening decision, QUICKLY and DECISIVELY,"" he wrote on his Truth Social platform.

The young Chinese caught in Trump's crosshairs,"Xiao Chen turned up at the US Consulate in Shanghai on Thursday morning, hours after Washington announced that it would""aggressively"" revoke the visas of Chinese students.

The 22-year-old had a visa appointment: she was headed to Michigan in the autumn to study communications. After a ""pleasant"" conversation, she was told her application had been rejected. She was not given a reason. ""I feel like a drifting duckweed tossed in wind and storm,"" she said, using a common Chinese expression to describe feeling both uncertain and helpless. She had been hopeful because she already had the acceptance letter. And she thought she had narrowly escaped the bombshells in recent days. First, Donald Trump's administration moved to endHarvard University's ability to enrol international students, a move that has since been blocked in court. And then it said it hadstoppedvisa appointmentsfor all foreign students. But now, Chen is ready for plan B. ""If I can't get the visa eventually, I'll probably take a gap year. Then I'll wait to see if things will get better next year."" A valid visa may still not be enough, she adds, because students with visas could be ""stopped at the airport and deported"". ""It's bad for every Chinese student. The only difference is how bad."" It has been a bleak week for international students in the US - and perhaps even harder for the 280,000 or so Chinese students who would have noticed that their country has been singled out. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Harvard of ""co-ordinating with the Chinese Communist Party"". Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the move against Chinese students in the US would include ""those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields"". That could hit a wide swathe of them given membership of the Communist Party is common among officials, entrepreneurs, business people and even artists and celebrities in China. Beijing has called it a ""politically motivated and discriminatory action"", and its foreign ministry has lodged a formal protest. There was a time when China sent the highest number of foreign students to American campuses. But those numbers slipped as the relationship between the two countries soured. A more powerful and increasingly assertive Beijing is now clashing with Washington for supremacy in just about everything, from trade to tech. Trump's first term had already spelled trouble for Chinese students. He signed an order in 2020 barring Chinese students and researchers with ties to Beijing's military from obtaining US visas. That order remained in place during President Joe Biden's term. Washington never clarified what constitutes  ""ties"" to the military, so many students had theirvisas revokedor were turned away at US borders, sometimes without a proper explanation. One of them, who did not wish to be named, said his visa was cancelled by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) when he landed in Boston in August 2023. He had been accepted into a post-doctoral program at Harvard University. He was going to study regenerative medicine with a focus on breast cancer, and had done his master's degree from a military-affiliated research institution in China. He said he was not a member of the Communist Party and his research had nothing to do with the military. ""They asked me what the relationship was between my research and China's defence affairs,"" he told the BBC then. ""I said, how could breast cancer have anything to do with national defence? If you know, please tell me."" He believes he never stood a chance because the officials had already made up their minds. He recalled one of them asking: ""Did Xi Jinping buy your suitcase for you?"" What was surprising, or even shocking then, slowly turned normal as more and more Chinese students struggled to secure visas or admissions to study science and technology in US universities. Mr Cao, a psychology major whose research involves neuroscience, has spent the past school year applying for PhD programs in the US. He had graduated from top-tier universities - credentials that could send him to an Ivy League school. But of the more than 10 universities he applied to, only one extended an offer. Trump's cuts to biomedical research didn't help, but the mistrust surrounding Chinese researchers was also a factor. Allegations and rumours of espionage, especially in sensitive subjects, have loomed over Chinese nationals at US universities in recent years, even derailing some careers. ""One of the professors even told me, 'We rarely give offers to Chinese students these days, so I cannot give you an interview,"" Mr Cao told the BBC in February. ""I feel like I am just a grain of sand under the wheel of time. There is nothing I can do."" For those who did graduate from US colleges, returning home to China has not been easy either. They used to be lauded as a bridge to the rest of the world. Now, they find that their once-coveted degrees don't draw the same reaction. Chen Jian, who did not want to use his real name, said he quickly realised that his undergraduate degree from a US college had become an obstacle. When he first came back in 2020, he interned at a state-owned bank and asked a supervisor if there was a chance to stay on. The supervisor didn't say it outright, but Chen got the message: ""Employees should have local degrees. People like me (with overseas degrees) won't even get a response."" He later realised that ""there really weren't any colleagues with overseas undergraduate background in the department"". He went back to the US and did his master's at Johns Hopkins University, and now works at Chinese tech giant Baidu. But despite the degree from a prestigious American university, Mr Chen does not feel he has an edge because of the stiff competition from graduates in China. What also has not helped is the suspicion around foreign graduates. Beijing has ramped up warnings of foreign spies, telling civilians to be on the lookout for suspicious figures. In April, prominent Chinese businesswoman Dong Mingzhu told shareholders in a closed-door meeting that her company, home appliance maker Gree Electric, will ""never"" recruit Chinese people educated overseas ""because among them are spies"". ""I don't know who is and who isn't,"" Ms Dong said, in comments that were leaked and went viral online. Days later, the CIA released promotional videos encouraging Chinese officials dissatisfied with the government to become spies and provide classified information. ""Your destiny is in your own hands,"" the video said. The suspicion of foreigners as the US and China pull further away from each other is  a surprising turn for many Chinese people who remember growing up in a very different country. Zhang Ni, who also did not want to use her real name, says she was ""very shocked"" by Ms Dong's remarks. The 24-year-old is a recent journalism graduate from Columbia University in New York. She says she ""doesn't care about working at Gree"", but what surprised her was the shift in attitudes. That so many Chinese companies ""don't like anything that might be associated with the international"" is a huge contrast from what Ms Zhang grew up with - a childhood ""filled with [conversations centred on] the Olympics and World Expo"". ""Whenever we saw foreigners, my mom would push me to go talk to them to practice my English,"" she says. That willingness to exchange ideas and learn from the outside world appears to be waning in China, according to many. And America, once a place that drew so many young Chinese people, is no longer that welcoming. Looking back, Ms Zhang can't help but recall a joke her friend made at a farewell dinner before she left for the US. Then a flippant comment, it now sums up the fear in both Washington and Beijing: ""Don't become a spy.""

His death was confirmed by FBI Director Kash Patel, who said the former police officer died Thursday after a ""private battle with illness."" Kerik oversaw the police response to the deadliest terrorist attack in US history, and was later appointed by former US President George Bush as head of a provisional police force in Iraq. He pleaded guilty to charges of tax fraud in 2009 and served three years in prison, though he was pardoned by President Donald Trump in 2020. Those who paid tribute to Kerik include former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was in office when Kerik served as commissioner of the NYPD, and current mayor Eric Adams. ""We've been together since the beginning. He's like my brother,"" Giuiliani said Thursday on his show. ""I was a better man for having known Bernie,"" Giuiliani said. ""I certainly was a braver and stronger man."" Adams, who had been friends with Kerik for nearly 30 years, said he had visited him in hospital before his death. ""He was with his loved ones who are in my prayers tonight,"" Adams said in a statement. ""He was a great New Yorker and American."" Kerik, a former army veteran and a decorated law enforcement officer, rose up the ranks through his career, and was nearly tapped to run the Department of Homeland Security under Bush in 2004 before he abruptly withdrew his nomination.

However, growth for full 2024-25 year, which runs between April and March, is pegged at 6.5% - the slowest in four years. The country's central bank - the Reserve Bank of India - meets later in June and is expected to cut rates for the third time in a row to boost growth. India remains the world's fastest growing major economy, although growth has sharply dropped from the 9.2% high recorded in financial year 2023-24. Asia's third-largest economy benefitted from strong farm activity, steady public spending and improved rural demand in the last financial year, even as manufacturing and new investments by private companies remained weak. While rural growth has improved on account of a strong winter harvest, it is not nearly enough to offset continuing weakness in urban consumption, which has flagged due to high unemployment and lower wages. India's growth engine remains heavily dependent on the government's infrastructure spending on roads, ports and highways, in the absence of significant improvement in private investment. Going forward, domestic growth should benefit from government's income tax cuts announced in the federal budget, as well as ""monetary easing, expectations of an above normal monsoon and lower food inflation"", Aditi Nayar, an economist with the ratings agency Icra, said. But ongoing global uncertainties, including US President Donald Trump's trade war, are expected to weigh on export demand. India is currently negotiating a trade-agreement with the United States which is officially expected to conclude by fall. Trump slapped tariffs of up to 27% on Indian goods in April – and a 90-day pause on these ends on 9 July. Economists expect GDP growth in the ongoing financial year 2025-26  to further slow to 6% on the back of these global slowdown worries which could delay new private capital spending on projects. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects global growth to drop to 2.8% in 2025 and 3% in 2026. Data from Icra earlier showed private sector expenditure, as part of overall investments in India's economy, fell to a 10-year low of 33% in the last financial year. Net foreign direct investment (FDI) into India – at $0.35bn in 2024-25 – also fell to the lowest level in two decades, as rising outward foreign investment and repatriations by Indian companies, neutralised inward investment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has been attempting to position India as a manufacturing hub for global companies. While companies like Apple indicated recently that it was shifting most of its production of iPhones headed to the US from China to India, trade analysts have cautioned that suchmanufacturing investment could yet stall, with the US and China agreeing to roll-back tariffs earlier this month.

Paul Doyle, 53, appeared at both Liverpool Magistrates' Court and Liverpool Crown Court on Friday where he faced seven charges including wounding with intent, causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent, attempting to cause GBH with intent and dangerous driving. The court heard the prosecution allege the father-of-three used his car ""as a weapon"" when it was driven into the crowds. Mr Doyle, of Burghill Road in West Derby, Liverpool appeared emotional as he appeared in court for the first time, speaking quietly only to confirm his date of birth and age. No family members or friends were present in either court rooms. Philip Astbury, prosecuting, said: ""This defendant, it is the prosecution's case, drove deliberately in that car at people amongst that crowd as they tried to leave the area. ""Six charges of assault reflect the most seriously injured of those who were struck by the vehicle. The first count of dangerous driving reflects the manner of driving before and up until the point he used his vehicle deliberately as a weapon to injure those individuals."" Mr Doyle faces charges relating to six victims, including two children aged 11 and 17, after a total of 79 people were injured in the city centre on Monday evening. The father-of-three of Burghill Road in West Derby, Liverpool was escorted into the dock at Liverpool Magistrates Court wearing a black suit, grey tie and white shirt. His case was then fast-tracked to Liverpool Crown Court, where more serious offences are dealt with. Mr Doyle was not asked to respond to the charges at the hearing. He sat with his head down as the charges were read to him, and was told he would next appear on 14 August for a plea hearing. Judge Andrew Menary KC said that reporting restrictions, introduced when Mr Doyle appeared before magistrates earlier, would remain in place. Those restrictions prohibit the identification of the six victims named in the charges so far from being published. Philip Astbury, prosecuting, told Judge Menary: ""This is an ongoing investigation and there are a great deal of witnesses to be interviewed and footage to be reviewed."" The court heard that the dangerous driving charge included Mr Doyle's home street of Burghill Road and Water Street, as well as unnamed roads in between. Damian Nolan, defending, said there would be no application for bail at the hearing. Judge Menary set a provisional trial date for 24 November, with an estimated length of three to four weeks. Mr Doyle stood with his hands clasped and nodded as he was remanded in custody. Hundreds of thousands of jubilant Liverpool fans packed the city centre on Bank Holiday Monday and lined the 10-mile (16km) parade route as Liverpool FC celebrated winning their second Premier League crown and 20th top-flight league title. Reports of a car colliding with pedestrians along Water Street, just off the parade route, were first received by police at about 18:00 on Monday. Ambulances arrived to take people to hospital, with a nine-year-old among the youngest victims of the incident. A pram carrying a baby boy was spun metres down the street when it was struck, but the child was not hurt. A fundraising campaign set up for those affected by the incident has raised more than £30,000, including a £10,000 donation from ex-player Jamie Carragher's charity foundation.

In a speech on Thursday, Lord Hermer criticised politicians who argue the UK should abandon ""the constraints of international law in favour of raw power"". He said similar claims had been made by legal theorists in Germany in the years before the Nazis came to power. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch accused him of ""calling people who disagree with him Nazis,"" and urged the prime minister to sack him. A spokesperson for Lord Hermer said he rejected ""the characterisation of his speech by the Conservatives"". But they added the Labour peer ""acknowledges though that his choice of words was clumsy and regrets having used this reference"". They added that the speech was aimed at ""defending international law which underpins our security, protects against threats from aggressive states like Russia and helps tackle organised immigration crime"". In a speech at the Royal United Services Institute think tank, Lord Hermer said the Labour government wanted to combine a ""pragmatic approach to the UK's national interests with a principled commitment to a rules-based international order"". He said the approach was ""a rejection of the siren song that can sadly now be heard in the Palace of Westminster, and in some spectrums of the media, that Britain abandons the constraints of international law in favour of raw power"". Lord Hermer added: ""This is not a new song. ""The claim that international law is fine as far as it goes, but can be put aside when conditions change, is a claim that was made in the early 1930s by 'realist' jurists in Germany, most notably Carl Schmitt, whose central thesis was in essence the claim that state power is all that counts, not law. ""Because of the experience of what followed in 1933, far-sighted individuals rebuilt and transformed the institutions of international law, as well as internal constitutional law."" Adolf Hitler became German chancellor in 1933. Carl Schmitt, a German legal scholar, was a supporter of the Nazi Party who sought to justify Hitler's policies in his writings on legal and political theory. The Conservatives and Reform UK have been critical of some elements of international law and the courts that enforce it. For example, some politicians from these parties have called for the UK to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), an international treaty which sets out the rights and freedoms people are entitled to in signatory countries, including the UK. Critics of the ECHR say it hampers the UK's ability to deal with migration issues, including deporting people who cross the English Channel on small boats. Badenoch, who has previously suggested the UK would have to leave the ECHR if it stops the country from doing ""what is right"", said Lord Hermer had shown ""appalling judgement"" in his speech. ""Now he's calling people who disagree with him Nazis,"" she added. ""This isn't just embarrassing, it's dangerous. Hermer doesn't understand government. ""If Keir Starmer had any backbone, he'd sack him."" Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice said Lord Hermer should apologise. ""If anyone on the right of politics used his language, there would be outrage,"" Tice posted on social media. ""He has shown himself as unfit to be attorney general.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0gye0wq8lo,real

In a speech on Thursday, Lord Hermer criticised politicians who argue the UK should abandon ""the constraints of international law in favour of raw power"". He said similar claims had been made by legal theorists in Germany in the years before the Nazis came to power. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch accused him of ""calling people who disagree with him Nazis,"" and urged the prime minister to sack him. A spokesperson for Lord Hermer said he rejected ""the characterisation of his speech by the Conservatives"". But they added the Labour peer ""acknowledges though that his choice of words was clumsy and regrets having used this reference"". They added that the speech was aimed at ""defending international law which underpins our security, protects against threats from aggressive states like Russia and helps tackle organised immigration crime"". In a speech at the Royal United Services Institute think tank, Lord Hermer said the Labour government wanted to combine a ""pragmatic approach to the UK's national interests with a principled commitment to a rules-based international order"". He said the approach was ""a rejection of the siren song that can sadly now be heard in the Palace of Westminster, and in some spectrums of the media, that Britain abandons the constraints of international law in favour of raw power"". Lord Hermer added: ""This is not a new song. ""The claim that international law is fine as far as it goes, but can be put aside when conditions change, is a claim that was made in the early 1930s by 'realist' jurists in Germany, most notably Carl Schmitt, whose central thesis was in essence the claim that state power is all that counts, not law. ""Because of the experience of what followed in 1933, far-sighted individuals rebuilt and transformed the institutions of international law, as well as internal constitutional law."" Adolf Hitler became German chancellor in 1933. Carl Schmitt, a German legal scholar, was a supporter of the Nazi Party who sought to justify Hitler's policies in his writings on legal and political theory. The Conservatives and Reform UK have been critical of some elements of international law and the courts that enforce it. For example, some politicians from these parties have called for the UK to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), an international treaty which sets out the rights and freedoms people are entitled to in signatory countries, including the UK. Critics of the ECHR say it hampers the UK's ability to deal with migration issues, including deporting people who cross the English Channel on small boats. Badenoch, who has previously suggested the UK would have to leave the ECHR if it stops the country from doing ""what is right"", said Lord Hermer had shown ""appalling judgement"" in his speech. ""Now he's calling people who disagree with him Nazis,"" she added. ""This isn't just embarrassing, it's dangerous. Hermer doesn't understand government. ""If Keir Starmer had any backbone, he'd sack him."" Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice said Lord Hermer should apologise. ""If anyone on the right of politics used his language, there would be outrage,"" Tice posted on social media.

And that means flexing its muscles to rid the seas around East and South East Asia of their US military presence, so it can dominate the shipping lanes so vital for global trade. By building up its nuclear and conventional arsenals, China aims to show the US that times have changed and that it's too dangerous a power to challenge. The US has long had the upper hand in the Asia-Pacific - with tens of thousands of troops based in Japan and South Korea, alongside several military bases. Trump's administration has clearly focused its energy on countering China - by initiating a trade war and seeking to strengthen alliances with Asian nations. The Shangri-La Dialogue has historically been the setting for top-level encounters between the US and China – an arena for the superpowers to set out their vision for security in the region. And it's opening again in Singapore on Friday. Here's what we can expect from the three-day event: The growing struggle for dominance between the US and China is undoubtedly the biggest issue in Asia-Pacific security. Gone are the days when China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) was characterised by outdated weaponry and rigid Maoist doctrine. Today it is a formidable force deploying state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles and fifth-generation warplanes like the J20. Its navy has the largest number of warships in the world, outstripping the United States. While China lags far behind the US and Russia in its number of nuclear warheads, it is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal, with missiles that can travel up to 15,000km, putting the continental US easily within range. The US Navy's formidable 7th Fleet, based in Yokosuka, just south of Tokyo, can no longer claim to have guaranteed naval supremacy in the region. China's array of Dong Feng missiles and swarms of explosive drones would make any approach to its shores extremely hazardous for US warships. Ultimately, Beijing is believed to be working to ""push"" the US military out of the western Pacific. Taiwan is a liberal, self-governing, pro-Western island democracy that China's President Xi Jinping has vowed to ""take back"" by force if necessary. It has an economic importance well beyond its geographic small size. It manufactures more than 90% of the world's high-end microchips, the all-important semi-conductors that power so much of our tech. Recent opinion polls have made clear that a majority of Taiwanese people do not want to be ruled by Beijing, but Xi has made this a key policy aim. The US has done much to help Taiwan bolster its defences but the key question of whether Washington would go to war with China over Taiwan has always been shrouded in something called ""strategic ambiguity"", i.e. keeping Beijing guessing. On more than one occasion President Biden indicated the US would respond militarily in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan. But the return of Donald Trump to the Oval Office has brought back a degree of uncertainty. There are also major concerns in the region over China's attempts to turn the entire South China Sea into what some have called a ""Chinese lake"". The PLA Navy has established military bases on reefs, many artificially dredged, across the strategically important South China Sea, an area through which an estimated $3 trillion's worth of maritime trade passes annually. Today China deploys a vast, industrial fishing fleet across the South China Sea, backed by its fleet of coastguard ships and warships. These vessels clash frequently with Filipino fishermen, fishing close to their own country's shores. China frequently challenges planes and ships transiting the South China Sea, warning them they are entering Chinese territory without permission, when the rest of the world considers this to be international waters. Donald Trump, when asked during his first presidency if North Korea could ever develop nuclear missiles that could reach the continental United States, vowed ""it's never going to happen"". But it has. In what amounts to a serious CIA intelligence failure, Pyongyang has demonstrated that it now possesses both the nuclear know-how and the means to deliver those warheads across the Pacific Ocean. Successive US presidencies have failed to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions and this isolated, economically backward yet militarily powerful nation is thought to have at least 20 nuclear warheads. It also has an enormous, well-armed army, some of which its autocratic leader Kim Jong Un has sent to help Russia fight Ukraine. Defence analysts are still dissecting the recent, brief but alarming conflict between these two nuclear-armed neighbours. India's military far outnumbers Pakistan's and yet the latter was allegedly able to land an embarrassing blow against India's air force, when Pakistan's Chinese-made J10-C jets went up against India's advanced, French-made Rafales. Pakistan reportedly shot down at least one of the Indian warplanes, using Chinese-made PL-15 air-to-air missiles. The reports were denied in India's media. China's assistance to Pakistan in the conflict has reportedly been critical to Islamabad, including repositioning its satellites to provide it with real-time intelligence. Both India and Pakistan are expected to make high-level addresses at the Shangri-La Dialogue this weekend while the US and others will be looking for ways to prevent a repeat of their clash over Kashmir. All of this is happening in a dramatically changed US context. Donald Trump's sudden imposition of trade tariffs, while eventually modified, has caused many in the region to rethink their reliance on Washington. Would an ally that is prepared to inflict so much economic pain on its friends really come to their aid if they were attacked? China has been quick to capitalise on the confusion. It reached out to neighbours such as Vietnam - a country it went to war with in 1979 - to point out the People's Republic represented stability and continuity in an unstable world. Under the previous US administration, Washington signed up to a multi-billion dollar trilateral partnership between the US, UK and Australia under the acronym of Aukus. It aims to not only build Canberra's next generation of submarines but to guarantee freedom of navigation across the South China Sea using intelligence and naval force deployed by the three nations. President Trump, when asked in February about his commitment to the Aukus pact, appeared not to recognise the term, asking in reply: ""What does that mean?"" But early this Saturday morning the US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth will be addressing the Shangri-La Dialogue, potentially offering some clarity on Aukus as well as how the US plans to work with, and quite possibly against, China's interests across the Asia-Pacific region. This video has been removed for editorial reasons Peng Yujiang told Chinese media he had narrowly avoided death after his video went viral.

It means the bank will be under full private ownership, almost two decades after it was bailed out by the taxpayer amid the 2008 financial crisis. This marks a symbolic end to a dramatic chapter in British banking history. It was gone midnight – the early hours of Monday 13 October 2008 - when Chancellor Alistair Darling turned in for the night, leaving a team of officials, surrounded by curries and pizza boxes, finalising the detail of the biggest state intervention in the private sector since World War Two. The next morning he announced the first instalment of a rescue that would cost the taxpayer more than the entire defence budget. In total the government spent £45bn (£73bn in today's money), buying an 84% stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), which now trades as part of the NatWest Group. At the time, RBS's balance sheet (outstanding loans) was bigger than the entire UK economy. Its collapse would have devastated it. The question is, why has it taken some 17 years for the Treasury to sell the last of its stake? And given that in the decades since fresh risks have emerged - including the threat of a cyber attack from a hostile state - how vulnerable does that leave UK banks today? Are they still ""too big to fail"", as they were widely described in 2008 - and were Britain to face another financial crisis, would the taxpayer have to step in once again to deliver a bailout? The current chair of NatWest group, Rick Haythornthwaite, has told the BBC that the bank and its employees remain thankful for that intervention in 2008. ""The main message to the taxpayer is one of deep gratitude,"" he says. ""They rescued this bank. They protected the millions of businesses and home-owners and savers."" A lot has changed since 2008. Gone are £1.5 trillion in outstanding loans, gone are tens of thousands of employees in job cuts, and gone is around £10bn of taxpayers' money – never to be recouped. The amount spent by the government looks like a poor investment, but as Baroness Shriti Vadera – former senior adviser to the government and chair of asset manager Prudential - told the BBC, this wasn't an investment, it was a rescue. ""Nationalising RBS was hardly a voluntary investment,"" she says. ""What was important then was assessing the impact of RBS and other banks on the overall economy and in particular the ability to keep functioning – lending, putting cash in ATMs. ""It was never about saving the banks, it was about saving the economy from the banks."" The consequences of a banking collapse would have been serious. The prime minister, Gordon Brown, even talked about putting soldiers on the streets. In a book by ex-Labour spin doctor Damian McBride, Brown is quoted as saying: ""If the banks are shutting their doors, and the cash points aren't working, and people go to Tesco and their cards aren't being accepted, the whole thing will just explode. ""If you can't buy food or petrol or medicine for your kids, people will just start breaking the windows and helping themselves."" RBS was of course not the only bank that faced collapse. A tsunami of bad loans had been triggered by an earthquake in the US mortgage market. Risky loans to borrowers with low credit ratings had been packaged up and sold to banks around the world. By 2007, no-one knew exactly where these grenades were hidden in bank balance sheets, so they all stopped lending to each other – which saw the whole global financial system seize up. Northern Rock relied on borrowing funds to finance its own risky mortgages and in 2007, the BBC reported that it had turned to the Bank of England for help. This prompted a ""run on the bank"", which finally saw it fully nationalised in February 2008. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, worked as the Bank's Chief Cashier during those turbulent months. He says if the state hadn't nationalised RBS, the costs would have been ""incalculable"". ""It would have been huge, because we were talking about the collapse of the banking system as we knew it at that time,"" recounts Bailey. US Banks were also in deep distress. In March 2008, Bear Stearns was absorbed by Wall Street rival JP Morgan. In September of that year, US mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were nationalised. Here in the UK, HBOS was absorbed by Lloyds and then of course, Lehman Brothers failed – defying expectations that the US government would step in to save it. But for the UK economy, RBS was the big one. The UK had a large banking sector, compared to the size of its economy; and within that mix, RBS was a particularly important bank. The once sedate RBS had become in some measure the biggest bank in the world. In 2000, it bought NatWest and just a year before the crash, it had bought Dutch bank ABN Amro. Its buccaneering boss Fred Goodwin had been knighted for his services to banking. But Mr Goodwin became a lightning rod for public outrage at the risks banks had taken and the bonuses their executives had collected. He left with an annual pension of £700,000 but was later stripped of his knighthood. The years following the rescue saw thousands of companies complain that the bankers RBS appointed to help them out of the crisis were driving them to the wall, forcing them into bankruptcy or selling their businesses at knock-down prices. RBS was the poster child for banking recklessness, hubris, greed and cruelty. Why then did it take so long for the government to sell out of RBS - at a loss of £10bn? At the same time the government took a stake in RBS, it also took a stake in Lloyds. But that was sold in May 2017, yielding a profit of £900m. RBS was infinitely more complicated than Lloyds as it had a large US business which was the subject of lengthy investigations by the US Department of Justice. The prospect of heavy fines hung over the bank for many years and proved well-founded when it was fined $4.9bn (£3.6bn) in 2018 for its role in the US mortgage crisis. RBS was also a pretty unattractive investment. It announced a £24bn loss for 2008 – the biggest loss in UK corporate history. It made losses every year until 2017. With the shares depressed by these concerns, the government was reluctant to sell its stake at low prices as it would crystallise a politically uncomfortable loss for the taxpayer. After all, following 2010, austerity was the name of the game and the then-Chancellor George Osborne could ill afford to be seen to be chalking up losses by selling RBS shares when he was making cuts elsewhere. But many think that was a mistake as – chicken and egg-like – it prolonged the reluctance of private shareholders to buy stakes in a company majority-owned by the government. As Baroness Vadera puts it: ""I'm not sure it was necessary to take 17 years to reverse out of the shares."" Mr Haythornthwaite, who took on the role of NatWest Group chairman in April last year, describes the sale of the final shares as a ""symbolic"" moment for the bank, its employees, investors - but also on a wider scale. ""I hope it's a symbolic moment for our nation [too],"" he says. ""That we can put this behind us. It allows us to truly look to the future."" But how exactly does that future look - and have lessons from the past really been learnt? Andrew Bailey certainly thinks so. He says that if a bank faces collapse now, it's less likely the taxpayer will have to step in. There are now alternative methods of rescuing a failing bank, he says, including buying assets and providing emergency cash. ""The big distinction is that we think we can handle [bank crises] without using public money,"" Bailey says. ""The critical thing is that we have to preserve the continuity of their activities, because they are critical to the economy … critical to people. ""When we say we've solved 'too big to fail', to be precise, I think what we mean is we don't need public money."" It is true that the Bank of England now stress-tests banks much more rigorously to see how they would cope under pressures like a collapse in house prices, rocketing unemployment or rampant inflation. Sir Philip Augar, a veteran of the City of London and author of multiple books on banking, agrees that British banks are in a more resilient position now than they were in 2008 - essentially because they hold more cash in their coffers, rather than just relying on debt. ""What's happened to improve things since then is that the amount of leverage in the system has come right down, and the capital cushion that banks have to hold […] has increased substantially. So it's less likely now that a bank would collapse - but it's not impossible."" Today, there are also new risks to consider. Take the series of cyber attacks that recently hit the systems of household names like Marks and Spencer, Co-op and Harrods. Should an attack take out critical banking functions like business lending, company payrolls and ATMs, it would be far more damaging. Indeed, in what he calls the ""league table"" of financial risks, Andrew Bailey identifies the threat of a cyber attack as a rapidly growing one. ""Of course you have to mitigate it, but [cyber] is a risk that will never go away, because it continually evolves,"" he says. ""We're dealing with bad actors who will continually refine the lines of attack. And I always have to say to institutions, 'You've got to continue to work at this'."" Recent bank collapses in the US – like Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank - have highlighted another major risk. Customers don't have to queue round a block to get their money out; it can be done with the stroke of a key on a laptop or mobile in seconds. Banks are built on trust: customers put money in, believing they can get it out again whenever they want.  And a good old-fashioned bank run is now a modern digital bank run. But banks are still not like normal companies. They are not standalone entities but interconnected, and together they form the bloodstream of the economy. They are the arteries through which credit is extended, wages are paid, savings are stashed or withdrawn. And when those arteries get blocked, bad things happen. That is as true today as it was in 2008.

""All of the music I've ever made now belongs to me,"" said the star, announcing the newson her official website.""I've been bursting into tears of joy... ever since I found out this is really happening."" The saga began in June 2019, when music manager Scooter Braun bought Swift's former record label Big Machine and, with it, all of the songs from Taylor Swift, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989 and Reputation. Swift had personal objections to the deal, blaming Braun for complicity in the ""incessant, manipulative bullying"" against her by Kanye West, one of his clients. On her website, Swift said that reclaiming the rights to her music had, for a long time, seemed unimaginable. ""To say this is my greatest dream come true is actually being pretty reserved about it,"" she added, thanking fans for their support as the drama played out. ""I can't thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but have never owned until now. ""I almost stopped thinking it could ever happen, after 20 years of having the carrot dangled and then yanked away,"" she wrote. ""But that's all in the past now."" In the music industry, the owner of a master recording controls the way it is distributed and licenced. The artist still earns royalties, but controlling the masters offers protection over how the work is used in future. Swift responded to the original sale of her masters by vowing to re-record those records, effectively diminishing the value of those master tapes, and putting ownership back in her hands. To date, she has released four re-recorded albums - known as ""Taylor's Versions"" - with dozens of bonus tracks and supplementary material. In her letter, the star told fans she had yet to complete the project, after ""hitting a stopping point"" while trying to remake 2017's Reputation album - which dealt with public scrutiny of her private life, and the fall-out of her feud with Kanye West. ""The Reputation album was so specific to that time in my life,"" she explained. ""All that defiance, that longing to be understood while feeling purposefully misunderstood... ""To be perfectly honest, it's the one album in those first six that I thought couldn't be improved by re-doing it... so I kept putting it off."" Last week, the star previewed the new version of Reputation's first single, Look What You Made Me Do, in an episode of The Handmaid's Tale - but her letter suggested that a full re-recording would be delayed or even scrapped. However, she promised that vault tracks from the record would be released at a future date, if fans were ""into the idea"". She also confirmed that she had re-recorded her self-titled debut, adding: ""I really love how it sounds now"". ""Those two albums can still have their moments to re-emerge when the time is right,"" she added. ""But if it happens, it won't be from a place of sadness and longing for what I wish I could have. It will just be a celebration now."" As the name suggests, a master recording is the original recorded performance of a song. Whoever owns it controls all the rights to exploit the music. That includes distributing it to streaming services, pressing new physical CDs and vinyl, creating box sets, or licensing songs to movies or video games. Swift, as the writer or co-writer of her music, always maintained her publishing rights, which meant she was able to veto attempts to license songs like Shake It Off and Love Story to other companies. ""I do want my music to live on. I do want it to be in movies. I do want it to be in commercials. But I only want that if I own it,"" she told Billboard in 2019. It is not known how much it cost Swift to acquire her masters, but the catalogue previously sold for $300m (£222m) in 2020. The BBC understands that rumours she paid between $600m to $1bn are inaccurately high. When 14-year-old Taylor Swift moved to Nashville in 2004 to chase her dream of becoming a country pop star, she signed a record deal with Big Machine. Label boss Scott Borchetta gave the unproven singer a big cash advance in exchange for having ownership of the master recordings to her first six albums ""in perpetuity"". This was fairly common practice in the era before streaming, when artists needed record label backing to get played on the radio, and for the manufacture and distribution of CDs. Swift's deal with Big Machine expired in 2018, at which point she left and signed with Republic Records and Universal Music Group (UMG). A year later, Borchetta sold his label to Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings. Swift said she only learned about the deal when it was announced; characterising it as an act of aggression that ""stripped me of my life's work"". She labelled Braun - who rose to prominence as the manager of Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande - as ""the definition of toxic male privilege in our industry"". She also expressed frustration that she had been unable to make a counter offer for her music. ""I spent 10 years of my life trying rigorously to purchase my masters outright and was then denied that opportunity,""she told Billboard, adding that: ""Artists should maybe have the first right of refusal to buy."" Braun later told Variety that the dispute had ""gotten out of hand"" after he and his family received death threats. The music mogul later sold his stake in Swift's back catalogue to Shamrock Holdings, a Los Angeles investment fund founded by the Disney family in 1978, in November 2020. The multi-million dollar deal left Swift feeling betrayed again. ""This is the second time my music had been sold without my knowledge,"" she said in a social media post. While she was ""open to the possibility of a partnership with Shamrock"", she subsequently learnt that, under the terms of the sale, Braun would ""continue to profit off my old music"" for years. ""I simply cannot in good conscience bring myself to be involved in benefiting Scooter Braun's interests,"" she wrote in a letter to the company, which she posted on X. She began releasing her re-recorded albums in 2021, starting with her breakthrough, coming-of-age album Fearless. Produced with forensic attention to detail, they were often indistinguishable from the originals - albeit with slightly cleaner mixes, and greater separation between the instruments. But the big attraction was the bonus tracks, including the unabridged, 10-minute version of her break-up ballad All Too Well - described by Variety magazine as the ""holy grail"" of the star's back catalogue. The song went on to top the US charts, and made number three in the UK - where it is the longest song ever to reach the top five. In the meantime, the singer continued to release original material, including the Grammy Award-winning albums Folklore and Midnights. In 2023, Forbes magazine reported that Swift had become the first musician to make $1 billion (£740 million) solely from songwriting and performing. Half of her fortune came from music royalties and touring, while the rest came from the increasing value of her music catalogue, including her re-recordings. Revisiting the old material also inspired Swift's career-spanning Eras tour, which made more than $2 billion (£1.48 billion) in ticket sales across 2023 and 2024. In her letter, Swift said the success of the Eras tour ""is why I was able to buy back my music"". She added that she was heartened to see her struggle inspiring other artists. ""Every time a new artist tells me they negotiated to own their master recordings in their record contract because of this fight, I'm reminded of how important it was for all of this to happen. ""Thank you being curious about something that used to be thought of as too industry-centric for broad discussion. ""You'll never know how much it means to me that you cared. Every single bit of it counted, and ended us up here."" Hull City Council hopes to submit another bid in 2027 to become a City of Music.

Charlotte May Lee, 21, from south London, was arrested earlier this month after authorities allegedly found 46kg of cannabis in her suitcases when she arrived on a flight from Thailand. ""I can't compare it to anything,"" she said, adding she shares a cell with five other women and sleeps on a thin mattress on the concrete floor, using her clothes as a pillow. Ms Lee has not yet been charged, but has previously denied knowing the alleged drugs were in her luggage. If found guilty, she could face up to 25 years behind bars. The former flight attendant told the BBC she had travelled from Bangkok to Sri Lanka's capital Colombo to renew her Thai visa. She made a procedural court appearance on Friday while the investigation into her alleged offences continues. Speaking to the BBC before appearing in court, Ms Lee appeared to be in good spirits. She described her living conditions at a prison in Negombo, a city just north of the capital, saying she spends most of her day inside, although she does get to go outside for fresh air. ""I have never been to prison and I've never been to Sri Lanka,"" she said. ""This heat and just sitting on a concrete floor all of the time."" Ms Lee said she tries not to dwell too much on her current predicament. ""I am not trying to think about it. If I think, then I feel bad. I'll still rather not process it."" She said she is concerned for the other women who are also in prison. ""There are people from so many different countries who have been here for two years, two-and-a-half years. And it's still just waiting and no-one actually knows anything."" She has managed to find other English-speaking women with whom she has developed a kinship. But she has not been able to speak with her family since her arrest. Ms Lee arrived at Negombo Magistrate's Court on Friday wearing a white knee-length dress, her long hair parted to the side. She was held in a cell at the back of the courtroom before being brought to the witness box. She was visibly upset as she stood with her hands crossed behind her back, facing the magistrate. Authorities wheeled in a large brown box containing the alleged 46kg of cannabis found in Ms Lee's luggage. The narcotics division of the Sri Lanka police told the court they intend to file an update on the investigation. Ms Lee's lawyer, Sampath Perera, asked if the alleged drugs had been examined by the relevant government authorities to ascertain if the materials were in fact an illegal substance. The magistrate ordered it to be tested and for a report to be submitted to the court as soon as possible. Speaking to the BBC from outside the courthouse after the hearing, Mr Perera said the next step is to make a bail application for Ms Lee, which could take three months. Under Sri Lankan law, people being held on remand must appear before a judge every 14 days. Ms Lee is being held on suspicion of keeping illegal drugs in her possession and drug smuggling. Her next court appearance will be on 13 July. Additional reporting by Charlotte Scarr",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8nj885l87o,real

It comes after shares in the budget airline closed above €21 (£17.65) for a 28th consecutive day on Thursday, meeting a key performance target. Mr O'Leary will have the option to receive 10 million shares worth some €111.2m (£93.3m) providing he stays with the airline until the end of July 2028. The Irish boss, known for his punchy comments, said earlier this month that Ryanair was ""delivering exceptional value"" to shareholders despite it reporting a fall in full-year profits. ""I think Ryanair shareholders are getting a particular value out of our share options - both mine and the rest of the management team,"" he said in response to being asked about the share option on an analyst call earlier this month. ""We're delivering exceptional value for Ryanair shareholders in an era when premiership footballers or the managers are getting paid 20 to 25 million a year."" Ryanair said in a statement that the share price aspect of the bonus was ""on only one of two conditions"", adding: ""The second condition is that Michael and the rest of the management team must remain employed by Ryanair until the end of July 2028, so these share options won't vest for another three years yet."" Mr O'Leary has indicated that he could stay on longer at the airline when his current contract expires in 2028. He has been with Ryanair since 1988. Since becoming chief executive in 1994, He has spearheaded the airline's sharp trajectory from a relatively small regional airline into a Europe's largest low-cost carrier. ""There'll have to be some discussion I presume with the board as to how my remuneration will be fixed from 2028 onwards, if they want me to stay on after 2028,"" he said. The long-term incentive scheme for Mr O'Leary was first set out in 2019, the year he became group chief executive. But the High Pay Centre, a think tank which tracks executives' pay, criticised the bonus, saying ""regardless of how successful a business or how effective the company's leader is, no-one individual's contribution can ever be great enough to be worth a €100m bonus"". A statement added: ""This is especially true when most of Ryanair's employees - who also play a crucial role in the company's success - are unlikely to earn more than a fraction of that across their whole working lives."" Low-cost rival carrier, Wizz Air has a similar potential pay deal in place for its chief executive József Váradi. Mr Váradi stands to earn £100m if his airline's share price hits £120 by 2028. But Wizz Air has previously conceded that this was unlikely to be met with the shares trading well below that level. Earlier this month, Ryanair ordered someflight attendants in Spain to repay salary increases following a legal dispute with their union. Several schemes to improve local connectivity are due to complete this summer. Robert Dale had a heart attack while waiting for his private hire licence to be renewed.

Washington and Beijing agreed to temporarily lower tit-for-tat tariffs after talks in Geneva earlier this month. But Trump said on Friday that China had ""totally violated its agreement with us"". He did not give details but US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer later said China had not been removing non-tariff barriers as agreed under the deal. Beijing's response on Friday did not address the US claims directly but urged the US to ""cease discriminatory restrictions against China"". The strong statements from both sides have raised concerns that trade tensions could again escalate between the world's two largest economies despite recent negotiations. Trump on Friday said in a Truth Social post that the tariffs his administration had imposed had been ""devastating"" for China and so he had ""made a FAST DEAL"" to save them from ""what I thought was going to be a very bad situation"". ""Everybody was happy! That is the good news!!! The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!"" He did not expand on his accusation, but Ambassador Greer later told TV network CNBC that China was yet to properly roll back other trade restrictions it had levied on the US. Greer said when China responded to the US's tariffs with its own, they also put in place countermeasures such as putting some US companies on blacklists and restricting exports of rare earth magnets, a critical component in cars, aircraft and semiconductors. ""They removed the tariff like we did but some of the countermeasures they've slowed on,"" Ambassador Greer said. He added the US had been closely watching China to make sure it would comply with the deal and they were ""very concerned"" with the progress. ""The United States did exactly what it was supposed to do and the Chinese are slow-rolling their compliance which is completely unacceptable and has to be addressed,"" Greer said. China responded on Friday urging the US to ""immediately correct its erroneous actions, cease discriminatory restrictions against China and jointly uphold the consensus reached at the high-level talks in Geneva"". A spokesman from its Washington embassy said China had recently ""repeatedly raised concerns"" with the US over its ""abuse of export control measures in the semiconductor sector"". The US already has restrictions in place on technology exports to China, and on Wednesday paused more sales to China of chip technologies - crucial to semiconductors - and also paused exports of chemicals and machinery. Pengyu Liu said both sides had maintained communication since the talks in  Geneva on 11 May, which had ended on a positive note. However on Thursday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had said trade talks with China had become ""a bit stalled"". Bessent told Fox News on Thursday: ""I think that given the magnitude of the talks, given the complexity, that this is going to require [leaders of both the countries] to weigh in with each other."" Trump's global tariff regime was dealt a blow on Wednesday following a ruling that he had exceeded his authority. His plans have been temporarily reinstated after the White House appealed the decision. His administration this week also moved to ""aggressively"" revoke the visas of Chinese students studying in the US, of which there are an estimated 280,000. In Geneva, Washington and Beijing had agreed to reduce tariffs imposed on each other's imports in a deal where both nations cancelled some tariffs altogether and suspended others for 90 days. Bessent said talks on a further deal had lost momentum, but stressed they were continuing. ""I believe that we will be having more talks with [China] in the next few weeks and I believe we may at some point have a call between the president and [Chinese President Xi Jinping],"" Bessent said on Thursday. He added the pair had ""a very good relationship"" and he was ""confident that the Chinese will come to the table when President Trump makes his preferences known"". Underthe deal struck earlier this month, the US lowered tariffs imposed on goods from China from 145% to 30%. China's retaliatory tariffs on US goods dropped from 125% to 10%. The US President has argued imposing tariffs on foreign goods would encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, bringing back manufacturing jobs while increasing the amount of tax revenue raised. They have been used by the Trump administration as leverage in negotiations as it seeks to reduce trade deficits with other nations. A delegation from Japan are continuing trade talks with their US counterparts in Washington on Friday. Bessent said ""a couple"" of US trade deals were ""very close"", but ""a couple of them are more complicated"". Trump's tariff regime remains in the balance following the decision by the US Court of International Trade, which ruled that Trump hadoverstepped his power by imposing the duties. Some analysts believe it will mean countries will be less likely to rush to secure trade deals with the US. A federal appeals court has granted a bid from the White House to temporarily suspend the lower court's order, which Trump described as ""horrific"". ""Hopefully, the Supreme Court will reverse this horrible, Country [sic] threatening decision, QUICKLY and DECISIVELY,"" he wrote on his Truth Social platform.

However, growth for full 2024-25 year, which runs between April and March, is pegged at 6.5% - the slowest in four years. The country's central bank - the Reserve Bank of India - meets later in June and is expected to cut rates for the third time in a row to boost growth. India remains the world's fastest growing major economy, although growth has sharply dropped from the 9.2% high recorded in financial year 2023-24. Asia's third-largest economy benefitted from strong farm activity, steady public spending and improved rural demand in the last financial year, even as manufacturing and new investments by private companies remained weak. While rural growth has improved on account of a strong winter harvest, it is not nearly enough to offset continuing weakness in urban consumption, which has flagged due to high unemployment and lower wages. India's growth engine remains heavily dependent on the government's infrastructure spending on roads, ports and highways, in the absence of significant improvement in private investment. Going forward, domestic growth should benefit from government's income tax cuts announced in the federal budget, as well as ""monetary easing, expectations of an above normal monsoon and lower food inflation"", Aditi Nayar, an economist with the ratings agency Icra, said. But ongoing global uncertainties, including US President Donald Trump's trade war, are expected to weigh on export demand. India is currently negotiating a trade-agreement with the United States which is officially expected to conclude by fall. Trump slapped tariffs of up to 27% on Indian goods in April – and a 90-day pause on these ends on 9 July. Economists expect GDP growth in the ongoing financial year 2025-26  to further slow to 6% on the back of these global slowdown worries which could delay new private capital spending on projects. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects global growth to drop to 2.8% in 2025 and 3% in 2026. Data from Icra earlier showed private sector expenditure, as part of overall investments in India's economy, fell to a 10-year low of 33% in the last financial year. Net foreign direct investment (FDI) into India – at $0.35bn in 2024-25 – also fell to the lowest level in two decades, as rising outward foreign investment and repatriations by Indian companies, neutralised inward investment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has been attempting to position India as a manufacturing hub for global companies. While companies like Apple indicated recently that it was shifting most of its production of iPhones headed to the US from China to India, trade analysts have cautioned that suchmanufacturing investment could yet stall, with the US and China agreeing to roll-back tariffs earlier this month.

Mokwa's District Head, Muhammad Shaba Aliyu, said it has been ""60 years"" since the community had suffered this kind of flooding. ""I beg the government to support us,"" Mr Aliyu said. The search and rescue operation is still ongoing and many more people are still at risk, authorities say. A local fisherman told the AFP news agency that he had been left homeless. ""I don't have a house to sleep in. My house has already collapsed,"" Danjuma Shaba said. Nigeria often experiences flooding during the rainy season, which usually lasts from April to October. The authorities have warned of heavy downpours in at least 15 of the country's 36 states. Last year, many parts of northern Nigeria experienced heavy rainfall and flooding which caused deaths, displacement of people and destruction of houses and infrastructure. The country also suffered severe flooding in 2022, which forced around 1.3 million people out of the homes and caused more than 600 deaths.

Washington and Beijing agreed to temporarily lower tit-for-tat tariffs after talks in Geneva earlier this month. But Trump said on Friday that China had ""totally violated its agreement with us"". He did not give details but US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer later said China had not been removing non-tariff barriers as agreed under the deal. Beijing's response on Friday did not address the US claims directly but urged the US to ""cease discriminatory restrictions against China"". The strong statements from both sides have raised concerns that trade tensions could again escalate between the world's two largest economies despite recent negotiations. Trump on Friday said in a Truth Social post that the tariffs his administration had imposed had been ""devastating"" for China and so he had ""made a FAST DEAL"" to save them from ""what I thought was going to be a very bad situation"". ""Everybody was happy! That is the good news!!! The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!"" He did not expand on his accusation, but Ambassador Greer later told TV network CNBC that China was yet to properly roll back other trade restrictions it had levied on the US. Greer said when China responded to the US's tariffs with its own, they also put in place countermeasures such as putting some US companies on blacklists and restricting exports of rare earth magnets, a critical component in cars, aircraft and semiconductors. ""They removed the tariff like we did but some of the countermeasures they've slowed on,"" Ambassador Greer said. He added the US had been closely watching China to make sure it would comply with the deal and they were ""very concerned"" with the progress. ""The United States did exactly what it was supposed to do and the Chinese are slow-rolling their compliance which is completely unacceptable and has to be addressed,"" Greer said. China responded on Friday urging the US to ""immediately correct its erroneous actions, cease discriminatory restrictions against China and jointly uphold the consensus reached at the high-level talks in Geneva"". A spokesman from its Washington embassy said China had recently ""repeatedly raised concerns"" with the US over its ""abuse of export control measures in the semiconductor sector"". The US already has restrictions in place on technology exports to China, and on Wednesday paused more sales to China of chip technologies - crucial to semiconductors - and also paused exports of chemicals and machinery. Pengyu Liu said both sides had maintained communication since the talks in  Geneva on 11 May, which had ended on a positive note. However on Thursday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had said trade talks with China had become ""a bit stalled"". Bessent told Fox News on Thursday: ""I think that given the magnitude of the talks, given the complexity, that this is going to require [leaders of both the countries] to weigh in with each other."" Trump's global tariff regime was dealt a blow on Wednesday following a ruling that he had exceeded his authority. His plans have been temporarily reinstated after the White House appealed the decision. His administration this week also moved to ""aggressively"" revoke the visas of Chinese students studying in the US, of which there are an estimated 280,000. In Geneva, Washington and Beijing had agreed to reduce tariffs imposed on each other's imports in a deal where both nations cancelled some tariffs altogether and suspended others for 90 days. Bessent said talks on a further deal had lost momentum, but stressed they were continuing. ""I believe that we will be having more talks with [China] in the next few weeks and I believe we may at some point have a call between the president and [Chinese President Xi Jinping],"" Bessent said on Thursday. He added the pair had ""a very good relationship"" and he was ""confident that the Chinese will come to the table when President Trump makes his preferences known"". Underthe deal struck earlier this month, the US lowered tariffs imposed on goods from China from 145% to 30%. China's retaliatory tariffs on US goods dropped from 125% to 10%. The US President has argued imposing tariffs on foreign goods would encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, bringing back manufacturing jobs while increasing the amount of tax revenue raised. They have been used by the Trump administration as leverage in negotiations as it seeks to reduce trade deficits with other nations. A delegation from Japan are continuing trade talks with their US counterparts in Washington on Friday. Bessent said ""a couple"" of US trade deals were ""very close"", but ""a couple of them are more complicated"". Trump's tariff regime remains in the balance following the decision by the US Court of International Trade, which ruled that Trump hadoverstepped his power by imposing the duties. Some analysts believe it will mean countries will be less likely to rush to secure trade deals with the US. A federal appeals court has granted a bid from the White House to temporarily suspend the lower court's order, which Trump described as ""horrific"". ""Hopefully, the Supreme Court will reverse this horrible, Country [sic] threatening decision, QUICKLY and DECISIVELY,"" he wrote on his Truth Social platform.

""All of the music I've ever made now belongs to me,"" said the star, announcing the newson her official website.""I've been bursting into tears of joy... ever since I found out this is really happening."" The saga began in June 2019, when music manager Scooter Braun bought Swift's former record label Big Machine and, with it, all of the songs from Taylor Swift, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989 and Reputation. Swift had personal objections to the deal, blaming Braun for complicity in the ""incessant, manipulative bullying"" against her by Kanye West, one of his clients. On her website, Swift said that reclaiming the rights to her music had, for a long time, seemed unimaginable. ""To say this is my greatest dream come true is actually being pretty reserved about it,"" she added, thanking fans for their support as the drama played out. ""I can't thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but have never owned until now. ""I almost stopped thinking it could ever happen, after 20 years of having the carrot dangled and then yanked away,"" she wrote. ""But that's all in the past now."" In the music industry, the owner of a master recording controls the way it is distributed and licenced. The artist still earns royalties, but controlling the masters offers protection over how the work is used in future. Swift responded to the original sale of her masters by vowing to re-record those records, effectively diminishing the value of those master tapes, and putting ownership back in her hands. To date, she has released four re-recorded albums - known as ""Taylor's Versions"" - with dozens of bonus tracks and supplementary material. In her letter, the star told fans she had yet to complete the project, after ""hitting a stopping point"" while trying to remake 2017's Reputation album - which dealt with public scrutiny of her private life, and the fall-out of her feud with Kanye West. ""The Reputation album was so specific to that time in my life,"" she explained. ""All that defiance, that longing to be understood while feeling purposefully misunderstood... ""To be perfectly honest, it's the one album in those first six that I thought couldn't be improved by re-doing it... so I kept putting it off."" Last week, the star previewed the new version of Reputation's first single, Look What You Made Me Do, in an episode of The Handmaid's Tale - but her letter suggested that a full re-recording would be delayed or even scrapped. However, she promised that vault tracks from the record would be released at a future date, if fans were ""into the idea"". She also confirmed that she had re-recorded her self-titled debut, adding: ""I really love how it sounds now"". ""Those two albums can still have their moments to re-emerge when the time is right,"" she added. ""But if it happens, it won't be from a place of sadness and longing for what I wish I could have. It will just be a celebration now."" As the name suggests, a master recording is the original recorded performance of a song. Whoever owns it controls all the rights to exploit the music. That includes distributing it to streaming services, pressing new physical CDs and vinyl, creating box sets, or licensing songs to movies or video games. Swift, as the writer or co-writer of her music, always maintained her publishing rights, which meant she was able to veto attempts to license songs like Shake It Off and Love Story to other companies. ""I do want my music to live on. I do want it to be in movies. I do want it to be in commercials. But I only want that if I own it,"" she told Billboard in 2019. It is not known how much it cost Swift to acquire her masters, but the catalogue previously sold for $300m (£222m) in 2020. The BBC understands that rumours she paid between $600m to $1bn are inaccurately high. When 14-year-old Taylor Swift moved to Nashville in 2004 to chase her dream of becoming a country pop star, she signed a record deal with Big Machine. Label boss Scott Borchetta gave the unproven singer a big cash advance in exchange for having ownership of the master recordings to her first six albums ""in perpetuity"". This was fairly common practice in the era before streaming, when artists needed record label backing to get played on the radio, and for the manufacture and distribution of CDs. Swift's deal with Big Machine expired in 2018, at which point she left and signed with Republic Records and Universal Music Group (UMG). A year later, Borchetta sold his label to Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings. Swift said she only learned about the deal when it was announced; characterising it as an act of aggression that ""stripped me of my life's work"". She labelled Braun - who rose to prominence as the manager of Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande - as ""the definition of toxic male privilege in our industry"". She also expressed frustration that she had been unable to make a counter offer for her music. ""I spent 10 years of my life trying rigorously to purchase my masters outright and was then denied that opportunity,""she told Billboard, adding that: ""Artists should maybe have the first right of refusal to buy."" Braun later told Variety that the dispute had ""gotten out of hand"" after he and his family received death threats. The music mogul later sold his stake in Swift's back catalogue to Shamrock Holdings, a Los Angeles investment fund founded by the Disney family in 1978, in November 2020. The multi-million dollar deal left Swift feeling betrayed again. ""This is the second time my music had been sold without my knowledge,"" she said in a social media post. While she was ""open to the possibility of a partnership with Shamrock"", she subsequently learnt that, under the terms of the sale, Braun would ""continue to profit off my old music"" for years. ""I simply cannot in good conscience bring myself to be involved in benefiting Scooter Braun's interests,"" she wrote in a letter to the company, which she posted on X. She began releasing her re-recorded albums in 2021, starting with her breakthrough, coming-of-age album Fearless. Produced with forensic attention to detail, they were often indistinguishable from the originals - albeit with slightly cleaner mixes, and greater separation between the instruments. But the big attraction was the bonus tracks, including the unabridged, 10-minute version of her break-up ballad All Too Well - described by Variety magazine as the ""holy grail"" of the star's back catalogue. The song went on to top the US charts, and made number three in the UK - where it is the longest song ever to reach the top five. In the meantime, the singer continued to release original material, including the Grammy Award-winning albums Folklore and Midnights. In 2023, Forbes magazine reported that Swift had become the first musician to make $1 billion (£740 million) solely from songwriting and performing. Half of her fortune came from music royalties and touring, while the rest came from the increasing value of her music catalogue, including her re-recordings. Revisiting the old material also inspired Swift's career-spanning Eras tour, which made more than $2 billion (£1.48 billion) in ticket sales across 2023 and 2024. In her letter, Swift said the success of the Eras tour ""is why I was able to buy back my music"". She added that she was heartened to see her struggle inspiring other artists. ""Every time a new artist tells me they negotiated to own their master recordings in their record contract because of this fight, I'm reminded of how important it was for all of this to happen. ""Thank you being curious about something that used to be thought of as too industry-centric for broad discussion. ""You'll never know how much it means to me that you cared. Every single bit of it counted, and ended us up here."" Hull City Council hopes to submit another bid in 2027 to become a City of Music.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow's conditions for a ceasefire would be discussed in Turkey. Russia is yet to send its proposals to Ukraine - a key demand by Kyiv. Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said on Thursday he had handed over his country's proposals to Russia, reaffirming ""readiness for a full and unconditional ceasefire"". The first round of talks in Istanbul on 16 May brought no breakthrough, aside from a prisoner of war swap - the biggest exchange since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. On Friday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha reiterated that Kyiv had already sent its own ""vision of future steps"" to Russia, adding Moscow ""must accept an unconditional ceasefire"" to pave the way for broader negotiations. ""We are interested in seeing these meetings continue because we want the war to end this year,"" Sybiha said during a joint press conference with his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan. If the talks go ahead on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are not expected to attend. But Fidan said Turkey was hoping to eventually host a high-level summit. ""We sincerely think it is time to bring President Trump, President Putin and President Zelensky to the table,"" he said. Peskov said Russia's ceasefire proposals would not be made public, and Moscow would only entertain the idea of a high-level summit if meaningful progress was achieved in preliminary discussions between the two countries. He welcomed comments made by Trump's envoy to Ukraine, retired Gen Keith Kellogg, who described Russian concerns over Nato enlargement as ""fair"". Gen Kellogg said Ukraine joining the military alliance, long hoped for by Kyiv, was not on the table. He added President Trump was ""frustrated"" by what he described as Russia's intransigence, but emphasised the need to keep negotiations alive. On 19 May, Trump and Putin had a two-hour phone call to discuss a US-proposed ceasefire deal to halt the fighting. The US president said he believed the call had gone ""very well"", adding that Russia and Ukraine would ""immediately start"" negotiations towards a ceasefire and ""an end to the war"". Ukraine has publicly agreed to a 30-day ceasefire but Putin has only said Russia will work with Ukraine to craft a ""memorandum"" on a ""possible future peace"" - a move described by Kyiv and its European allies as delaying tactics so Russian troops could seize more Ukrainian territory. In a rare rebuke to Putin just days later, Trump called the Kremlin leader ""absolutely crazy"" and threatened US sanctions. His comments followed Moscow's largest drone and missile attacks on Ukraine. On Wednesday, Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, told Zelensky that Berlin would help Kyiv produce long-range missiles to defend itself from future Russian attacks. The Kremlin said any decision to end range restrictions on the missiles Ukraine could use would represent a dangerous change in policy that would harm efforts to bring an end to the war. Moscow currently controls 20% of Ukraine's internationally-recognised territory, including the southern peninsula of Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. Those who unbuckle before the ""fasten seatbelt"" sign is turned off face a fine, aviation authority says.

""All of the music I've ever made now belongs to me,"" said the star, announcing the newson her official website.""I've been bursting into tears of joy... ever since I found out this is really happening."" The saga began in June 2019, when music manager Scooter Braun bought Swift's former record label Big Machine and, with it, all of the songs from Taylor Swift, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989 and Reputation. Swift had personal objections to the deal, blaming Braun for complicity in the ""incessant, manipulative bullying"" against her by Kanye West, one of his clients. On her website, Swift said that reclaiming the rights to her music had, for a long time, seemed unimaginable. ""To say this is my greatest dream come true is actually being pretty reserved about it,"" she added, thanking fans for their support as the drama played out. ""I can't thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but have never owned until now. ""I almost stopped thinking it could ever happen, after 20 years of having the carrot dangled and then yanked away,"" she wrote. ""But that's all in the past now."" In the music industry, the owner of a master recording controls the way it is distributed and licenced. The artist still earns royalties, but controlling the masters offers protection over how the work is used in future. Swift responded to the original sale of her masters by vowing to re-record those records, effectively diminishing the value of those master tapes, and putting ownership back in her hands. To date, she has released four re-recorded albums - known as ""Taylor's Versions"" - with dozens of bonus tracks and supplementary material. In her letter, the star told fans she had yet to complete the project, after ""hitting a stopping point"" while trying to remake 2017's Reputation album - which dealt with public scrutiny of her private life, and the fall-out of her feud with Kanye West. ""The Reputation album was so specific to that time in my life,"" she explained. ""All that defiance, that longing to be understood while feeling purposefully misunderstood... ""To be perfectly honest, it's the one album in those first six that I thought couldn't be improved by re-doing it... so I kept putting it off."" Last week, the star previewed the new version of Reputation's first single, Look What You Made Me Do, in an episode of The Handmaid's Tale - but her letter suggested that a full re-recording would be delayed or even scrapped. However, she promised that vault tracks from the record would be released at a future date, if fans were ""into the idea"". She also confirmed that she had re-recorded her self-titled debut, adding: ""I really love how it sounds now"". ""Those two albums can still have their moments to re-emerge when the time is right,"" she added. ""But if it happens, it won't be from a place of sadness and longing for what I wish I could have. It will just be a celebration now."" As the name suggests, a master recording is the original recorded performance of a song. Whoever owns it controls all the rights to exploit the music. That includes distributing it to streaming services, pressing new physical CDs and vinyl, creating box sets, or licensing songs to movies or video games. Swift, as the writer or co-writer of her music, always maintained her publishing rights, which meant she was able to veto attempts to license songs like Shake It Off and Love Story to other companies. ""I do want my music to live on. I do want it to be in movies. I do want it to be in commercials. But I only want that if I own it,"" she told Billboard in 2019. It is not known how much it cost Swift to acquire her masters, but the catalogue previously sold for $300m (£222m) in 2020. The BBC understands that rumours she paid between $600m to $1bn are inaccurately high. When 14-year-old Taylor Swift moved to Nashville in 2004 to chase her dream of becoming a country pop star, she signed a record deal with Big Machine. Label boss Scott Borchetta gave the unproven singer a big cash advance in exchange for having ownership of the master recordings to her first six albums ""in perpetuity"". This was fairly common practice in the era before streaming, when artists needed record label backing to get played on the radio, and for the manufacture and distribution of CDs. Swift's deal with Big Machine expired in 2018, at which point she left and signed with Republic Records and Universal Music Group (UMG). A year later, Borchetta sold his label to Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings. Swift said she only learned about the deal when it was announced; characterising it as an act of aggression that ""stripped me of my life's work"". She labelled Braun - who rose to prominence as the manager of Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande - as ""the definition of toxic male privilege in our industry"". She also expressed frustration that she had been unable to make a counter offer for her music. ""I spent 10 years of my life trying rigorously to purchase my masters outright and was then denied that opportunity,""she told Billboard, adding that: ""Artists should maybe have the first right of refusal to buy."" Braun later told Variety that the dispute had ""gotten out of hand"" after he and his family received death threats. The music mogul later sold his stake in Swift's back catalogue to Shamrock Holdings, a Los Angeles investment fund founded by the Disney family in 1978, in November 2020. The multi-million dollar deal left Swift feeling betrayed again. ""This is the second time my music had been sold without my knowledge,"" she said in a social media post. While she was ""open to the possibility of a partnership with Shamrock"", she subsequently learnt that, under the terms of the sale, Braun would ""continue to profit off my old music"" for years. ""I simply cannot in good conscience bring myself to be involved in benefiting Scooter Braun's interests,"" she wrote in a letter to the company, which she posted on X. She began releasing her re-recorded albums in 2021, starting with her breakthrough, coming-of-age album Fearless. Produced with forensic attention to detail, they were often indistinguishable from the originals - albeit with slightly cleaner mixes, and greater separation between the instruments. But the big attraction was the bonus tracks, including the unabridged, 10-minute version of her break-up ballad All Too Well - described by Variety magazine as the ""holy grail"" of the star's back catalogue. The song went on to top the US charts, and made number three in the UK - where it is the longest song ever to reach the top five. In the meantime, the singer continued to release original material, including the Grammy Award-winning albums Folklore and Midnights. In 2023, Forbes magazine reported that Swift had become the first musician to make $1 billion (£740 million) solely from songwriting and performing. Half of her fortune came from music royalties and touring, while the rest came from the increasing value of her music catalogue, including her re-recordings. Revisiting the old material also inspired Swift's career-spanning Eras tour, which made more than $2 billion (£1.48 billion) in ticket sales across 2023 and 2024. In her letter, Swift said the success of the Eras tour ""is why I was able to buy back my music"". She added that she was heartened to see her struggle inspiring other artists. ""Every time a new artist tells me they negotiated to own their master recordings in their record contract because of this fight, I'm reminded of how important it was for all of this to happen. ""Thank you being curious about something that used to be thought of as too industry-centric for broad discussion. ""You'll never know how much it means to me that you cared. Every single bit of it counted, and ended us up here."" Hull City Council hopes to submit another bid in 2027 to become a City of Music.

He said similar claims had been made by legal theorists in Germany in the years before the Nazis came to power. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch accused him of ""calling people who disagree with him Nazis,"" and urged the prime minister to sack him. A spokesperson for Lord Hermer said he rejected ""the characterisation of his speech by the Conservatives"". But they added the Labour peer ""acknowledges though that his choice of words was clumsy and regrets having used this reference"". They added that the speech was aimed at ""defending international law which underpins our security, protects against threats from aggressive states like Russia and helps tackle organised immigration crime"". In a speech at the Royal United Services Institute think tank, Lord Hermer said the Labour government wanted to combine a ""pragmatic approach to the UK's national interests with a principled commitment to a rules-based international order"". He said the approach was ""a rejection of the siren song that can sadly now be heard in the Palace of Westminster, and in some spectrums of the media, that Britain abandons the constraints of international law in favour of raw power"". Lord Hermer added: ""This is not a new song. ""The claim that international law is fine as far as it goes, but can be put aside when conditions change, is a claim that was made in the early 1930s by 'realist' jurists in Germany, most notably Carl Schmitt, whose central thesis was in essence the claim that state power is all that counts, not law. ""Because of the experience of what followed in 1933, far-sighted individuals rebuilt and transformed the institutions of international law, as well as internal constitutional law."" Adolf Hitler became German chancellor in 1933. Carl Schmitt, a German legal scholar, was a supporter of the Nazi Party who sought to justify Hitler's policies in his writings on legal and political theory. The Conservatives and Reform UK have been critical of some elements of international law and the courts that enforce it. For example, some politicians from these parties have called for the UK to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), an international treaty which sets out the rights and freedoms people are entitled to in signatory countries, including the UK. Critics of the ECHR say it hampers the UK's ability to deal with migration issues, including deporting people who cross the English Channel on small boats. Badenoch, who has previously suggested the UK would have to leave the ECHR if it stops the country from doing ""what is right"", said Lord Hermer had shown ""appalling judgement"" in his speech. ""Now he's calling people who disagree with him Nazis,"" she added. ""This isn't just embarrassing, it's dangerous. Hermer doesn't understand government. ""If Keir Starmer had any backbone, he'd sack him."" Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice said Lord Hermer should apologise.

Mr Doyle, of Burghill Road in West Derby, Liverpool appeared emotional as he appeared in court for the first time, speaking quietly only to confirm his date of birth and age. No family members or friends were present in either court rooms. Philip Astbury, prosecuting, said: ""This defendant, it is the prosecution's case, drove deliberately in that car at people amongst that crowd as they tried to leave the area. ""Six charges of assault reflect the most seriously injured of those who were struck by the vehicle. The first count of dangerous driving reflects the manner of driving before and up until the point he used his vehicle deliberately as a weapon to injure those individuals."" Mr Doyle faces charges relating to six victims, including two children aged 11 and 17, after a total of 79 people were injured in the city centre on Monday evening. The father-of-three of Burghill Road in West Derby, Liverpool was escorted into the dock at Liverpool Magistrates Court wearing a black suit, grey tie and white shirt. His case was then fast-tracked to Liverpool Crown Court, where more serious offences are dealt with. Mr Doyle was not asked to respond to the charges at the hearing. He sat with his head down as the charges were read to him, and was told he would next appear on 14 August for a plea hearing. Judge Andrew Menary KC said that reporting restrictions, introduced when Mr Doyle appeared before magistrates earlier, would remain in place. Those restrictions prohibit the identification of the six victims named in the charges so far from being published. Philip Astbury, prosecuting, told Judge Menary: ""This is an ongoing investigation and there are a great deal of witnesses to be interviewed and footage to be reviewed."" The court heard that the dangerous driving charge included Mr Doyle's home street of Burghill Road and Water Street, as well as unnamed roads in between. Damian Nolan, defending, said there would be no application for bail at the hearing. Judge Menary set a provisional trial date for 24 November, with an estimated length of three to four weeks. Mr Doyle stood with his hands clasped and nodded as he was remanded in custody. Hundreds of thousands of jubilant Liverpool fans packed the city centre on Bank Holiday Monday and lined the 10-mile (16km) parade route as Liverpool FC celebrated winning their second Premier League crown and 20th top-flight league title. Reports of a car colliding with pedestrians along Water Street, just off the parade route, were first received by police at about 18:00 on Monday. Ambulances arrived to take people to hospital, with a nine-year-old among the youngest victims of the incident. A pram carrying a baby boy was spun metres down the street when it was struck, but the child was not hurt. A fundraising campaign set up for those affected by the incident has raised more than £30,000, including a £10,000 donation from ex-player Jamie Carragher's charity foundation.

The ruling put on hold a previous federal judge's order stopping the administration from ending the ""parole"" immigration programme, established by former President Joe Biden. The programme protected immigrants fleeing economic and political turmoil in their home countries. The new order puts roughly 530,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela at risk of being deported. Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor, two of the court's three liberal justices, dissented. The parole programme allows immigrants temporary status to work and live in the US for two years because of ""urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit"", according to the US government. The Trump administration had filed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court after a federal judge in Massachusetts blocked the administration from ending the programme, also known as CHNV humanitarian parole. The White House ""celebrated"" the opportunity to deport 500,000 ""invaders"", White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller told CNN. ""The Supreme Court justly stepped in"". In her dissent, Justice Jackson wrote that the court's order would ""have the lives of half a million migrants unravel all around us before the courts decide their legal claims"". On the day he took office, Trump signed an executive order directing the Department of Homeland Security to get rid of parole programmes. Then, in March, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the end of CHNV humanitarian parole. Several immigrants rights groups and migrants from the programme sued the Trump administration over the decision, arguing they could ""face serious risks of danger, persecution and even death"" if deported back to their home countries. The ruling comes after the Supreme Court earlier this month allowed Trump officials to revoke Temporary Protected Status (TPS) - a separate programme - for some 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants living and working in the US. Humanitarian parole programmes have been used for decades to allow immigrants fleeing war and other tumultuous conditions in their home countries to come to the US, including Cubans in the 1960s following the revolution. The Biden administration also established a parole programme in 2022 for Ukrainians fleeing after Russia's invasion.

Mr Jaiswal also spoke about the Trump administration's updated policy on student visas which is likely to impact Indian students planning to enrol in US universities. The US had announced on Thursday that it had halted the scheduling of new visa interviews for foreign students as it considered expanding the screening of their social media activities.

Charlotte May Lee, 21, from south London, was arrested earlier this month after authorities allegedly found 46kg of cannabis in her suitcases when she arrived on a flight from Thailand. ""I can't compare it to anything,"" she said, adding she shares a cell with five other women and sleeps on a thin mattress on the concrete floor, using her clothes as a pillow. Ms Lee has not yet been charged, but has previously denied knowing the alleged drugs were in her luggage. If found guilty, she could face up to 25 years behind bars. The former flight attendant told the BBC she had travelled from Bangkok to Sri Lanka's capital Colombo to renew her Thai visa. She made a procedural court appearance on Friday while the investigation into her alleged offences continues. Speaking to the BBC before appearing in court, Ms Lee appeared to be in good spirits. She described her living conditions at a prison in Negombo, a city just north of the capital, saying she spends most of her day inside, although she does get to go outside for fresh air. ""I have never been to prison and I've never been to Sri Lanka,"" she said. ""This heat and just sitting on a concrete floor all of the time."" Ms Lee said she tries not to dwell too much on her current predicament. ""I am not trying to think about it. If I think, then I feel bad. I'll still rather not process it."" She said she is concerned for the other women who are also in prison. ""There are people from so many different countries who have been here for two years, two-and-a-half years. And it's still just waiting and no-one actually knows anything."" She has managed to find other English-speaking women with whom she has developed a kinship. But she has not been able to speak with her family since her arrest. Ms Lee arrived at Negombo Magistrate's Court on Friday wearing a white knee-length dress, her long hair parted to the side. She was held in a cell at the back of the courtroom before being brought to the witness box. She was visibly upset as she stood with her hands crossed behind her back, facing the magistrate. Authorities wheeled in a large brown box containing the alleged 46kg of cannabis found in Ms Lee's luggage. The narcotics division of the Sri Lanka police told the court they intend to file an update on the investigation. Ms Lee's lawyer, Sampath Perera, asked if the alleged drugs had been examined by the relevant government authorities to ascertain if the materials were in fact an illegal substance. The magistrate ordered it to be tested and for a report to be submitted to the court as soon as possible. Speaking to the BBC from outside the courthouse after the hearing, Mr Perera said the next step is to make a bail application for Ms Lee, which could take three months. Under Sri Lankan law, people being held on remand must appear before a judge every 14 days. Ms Lee is being held on suspicion of keeping illegal drugs in her possession and drug smuggling. Her next court appearance will be on 13 July. Additional reporting by Charlotte Scarr",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8nj885l87o,real

Earlier this week, the South African-born billionaire, on his social media platform, X, thanked President Trump for histime at the Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge. Trump announced he will host a news conference in the Oval Office on Friday with Musk, writing: ""This will be his last day, but not really, because he will, always, be with us, helping all the way."" While Musk's time in government lasted little more than four months, his work with Doge upended the federal government and had an impact not just in the halls of power in Washington - but around the world. Let's take a look at some of the ways Musk has left a mark. Musk took a job with the Trump White House with one mission: to cut spending from the government as much as possible. He began with an initial target of ""at least $2 trillion"", which then shifted to $1tn and ultimately $150bn. To date, Doge claims to have saved $175bn through a combination of asset sales, lease and grant cancellations, ""fraud and improper payment deletion"", regulatory savings and a 260,000-person reduction from the 2.3 million-strong federal workforce. ABBC analysis of those figures,however, found that evidence is sometimes lacking. This mission has at times caused both chaos and controversy, including some instances in which federal judges halted mass firings and ordered employees reinstated. In other instances, the administration has been forced to backtrack on firings. In one notable instance in February, the administration stopped the firing of hundreds of federal employees working at the National Nuclear Security Administration, including some with sensitive jobs related to the US nuclear arsenal. Musk himself repeatedly acknowledged that mass firings would inevitably include mistakes. ""We will make mistakes,"" he said in February, after his department mistook a region of Mozambique for Hamas-controlled Gaza while cutting an aid programme. ""But we'll act quickly to correct any mistakes."" Doge's efforts to access data also garnered controversy, particularly the department's push for access to sensitive treasury department systems that control the private information of millions of Americans. Polls show that cuts to government spending remain popular with many Americans - even if Musk's personal popularity has waned. The presence of Musk - an unelected ""special government employee"" with companies that count the US government as customers - in Trump's White House has also raised eyebrows, prompting questions about potential conflicts of interest. His corporate empire includes large companies that do business with US and foreign governments. SpaceX has $22 billion in US government contracts, according to the company's chief executive. Some Democrats also accused Musk of taking advantage of his position to drum up business abroad for his satellite internet services firm, Starlink. The White House was accused of helping Musk's businesses by showcasing vehicles made by Tesla - his embattled car company - on the White House lawn in March. Musk and Trump have both shrugged off any suggestion that his work with the government is conflicted or ethically problematic. Around the world, Musk's work with Doge was most felt after the vast majority - over 80% - of the US Agency for International Development's (USAID's) programmes were eliminated following a six-week review by Doge. The rest were absorbed by the State Department. The Musk and Doge-led cuts formed part of a wider effort by the Trump administration to bring overseas spending closer in line with its ""America First"" approach. The cuts to the agency - tasked with work such as famine detection, vaccinations and food aid in conflict areas - quickly had an impact on projects includingcommunal kitchens in war-torn Sudan, scholarshipsfor young Afghan womenwho fled the Taliban and clinicsfor transgender people in India. USAID also was a crucial instrument of US ""soft power"" around the world, leading some detractors pointing to its elimination as a sign of waning American influence on the global stage. While Musk - and Trump - have for years been accused by detractors of spreading baseless conspiracy theories, Musk's presence in the White House starkly highlighted how misinformation has crept into discourse at the highest levels of the US government. For example, Musk spread an unfounded internet theory that US gold reserves had quietly been stolen from Fort Knox in Kentucky. At one point, he floated the idea of livestreaming a visit there to ensure the gold was secured. More recently,Musk spread widely discredited rumours that the white Afrikaner population of South Africa is facing ""genocide"" in their home country. Those rumours found their way into the Oval Office earlier in May, when a meeting aimed at soothing tensions between the US and South Africa took a drastic twist after Trump presented South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with videos and articles he said were evidence of crimes against Afrikaners. Musk's work in government also showed that, despite public pledges of unity, there are tensions within the ""Trump 2.0"" administration. While Trump publicly - and repeatedly - backed the work of Musk and Doge, Musk's tenure was marked by reports of tension between him and members of the cabinet who felt Doge cuts were impacting their agencies. ""They have a lot of respect for Elon and that he's doing this, and some disagree a little bit,"" Trump acknowledged in a February cabinet meeting. ""If they aren't, I want them to speak up."" At one point, he was asked whether any cabinet members had expressed dissatisfaction with Musk and turned to the room to ask them. No one spoke. The announcement of Musk's departure also came the same day that CBS - the BBC's US partner - publicised part of an interview during which Musk said he was""disappointed"" by Trump's ""big, beautiful"" budget bill.The bill includes multi-trillion dollar tax breaks and a pledge to increase defence spending. Musk said the bill ""undermines"" the work of Doge to cut spending - reflecting larger tensions within the Republican Party over the path forward.

In a speech on Thursday, Lord Hermer criticised politicians who argue the UK should abandon ""the constraints of international law in favour of raw power"". He said similar claims had been made by legal theorists in Germany in the years before the Nazis came to power. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch accused him of ""calling people who disagree with him Nazis,"" and urged the prime minister to sack him. A spokesperson for Lord Hermer said he rejected ""the characterisation of his speech by the Conservatives"". But they added the Labour peer ""acknowledges though that his choice of words was clumsy and regrets having used this reference"". They added that the speech was aimed at ""defending international law which underpins our security, protects against threats from aggressive states like Russia and helps tackle organised immigration crime"". In a speech at the Royal United Services Institute think tank, Lord Hermer said the Labour government wanted to combine a ""pragmatic approach to the UK's national interests with a principled commitment to a rules-based international order"". He said the approach was ""a rejection of the siren song that can sadly now be heard in the Palace of Westminster, and in some spectrums of the media, that Britain abandons the constraints of international law in favour of raw power"". Lord Hermer added: ""This is not a new song. ""The claim that international law is fine as far as it goes, but can be put aside when conditions change, is a claim that was made in the early 1930s by 'realist' jurists in Germany, most notably Carl Schmitt, whose central thesis was in essence the claim that state power is all that counts, not law. ""Because of the experience of what followed in 1933, far-sighted individuals rebuilt and transformed the institutions of international law, as well as internal constitutional law."" Adolf Hitler became German chancellor in 1933. Carl Schmitt, a German legal scholar, was a supporter of the Nazi Party who sought to justify Hitler's policies in his writings on legal and political theory. The Conservatives and Reform UK have been critical of some elements of international law and the courts that enforce it. For example, some politicians from these parties have called for the UK to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), an international treaty which sets out the rights and freedoms people are entitled to in signatory countries, including the UK. Critics of the ECHR say it hampers the UK's ability to deal with migration issues, including deporting people who cross the English Channel on small boats. Badenoch, who has previously suggested the UK would have to leave the ECHR if it stops the country from doing ""what is right"", said Lord Hermer had shown ""appalling judgement"" in his speech. ""Now he's calling people who disagree with him Nazis,"" she added. ""This isn't just embarrassing, it's dangerous. Hermer doesn't understand government. ""If Keir Starmer had any backbone, he'd sack him."" Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice said Lord Hermer should apologise. ""If anyone on the right of politics used his language, there would be outrage,"" Tice posted on social media. ""He has shown himself as unfit to be attorney general.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0gye0wq8lo,real

The new order puts roughly 530,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela at risk of being deported. Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor, two of the court's three liberal justices, dissented. The parole programme allows immigrants temporary status to work and live in the US for two years because of ""urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit"", according to the US government. The Trump administration had filed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court after a federal judge in Massachusetts blocked the administration from ending the programme, also known as CHNV humanitarian parole.

In her dissent, Justice Jackson wrote that the court's order would ""have the lives of half a million migrants unravel all around us before the courts decide their legal claims"". On the day he took office, Trump signed an executive order directing the Department of Homeland Security to get rid of parole programmes. Then, in March, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the end of CHNV humanitarian parole. Several immigrants rights groups and migrants from the programme sued the Trump administration over the decision, arguing they could ""face serious risks of danger, persecution and even death"" if deported back to their home countries. The ruling comes after the Supreme Court earlier this month allowed Trump officials to revoke Temporary Protected Status (TPS) - a separate programme - for some 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants living and working in the US.

However, growth for full 2024-25 year, which runs between April and March, is pegged at 6.5% - the slowest in four years. The country's central bank - the Reserve Bank of India - meets later in June and is expected to cut rates for the third time in a row to boost growth. India remains the world's fastest growing major economy, although growth has sharply dropped from the 9.2% high recorded in financial year 2023-24. Asia's third-largest economy benefitted from strong farm activity, steady public spending and improved rural demand in the last financial year, even as manufacturing and new investments by private companies remained weak. While rural growth has improved on account of a strong winter harvest, it is not nearly enough to offset continuing weakness in urban consumption, which has flagged due to high unemployment and lower wages. India's growth engine remains heavily dependent on the government's infrastructure spending on roads, ports and highways, in the absence of significant improvement in private investment. Going forward, domestic growth should benefit from government's income tax cuts announced in the federal budget, as well as ""monetary easing, expectations of an above normal monsoon and lower food inflation"", Aditi Nayar, an economist with the ratings agency Icra, said. But ongoing global uncertainties, including US President Donald Trump's trade war, are expected to weigh on export demand. India is currently negotiating a trade-agreement with the United States which is officially expected to conclude by fall. Trump slapped tariffs of up to 27% on Indian goods in April – and a 90-day pause on these ends on 9 July. Economists expect GDP growth in the ongoing financial year 2025-26  to further slow to 6% on the back of these global slowdown worries which could delay new private capital spending on projects. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects global growth to drop to 2.8% in 2025 and 3% in 2026. Data from Icra earlier showed private sector expenditure, as part of overall investments in India's economy, fell to a 10-year low of 33% in the last financial year. Net foreign direct investment (FDI) into India – at $0.35bn in 2024-25 – also fell to the lowest level in two decades, as rising outward foreign investment and repatriations by Indian companies, neutralised inward investment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has been attempting to position India as a manufacturing hub for global companies. While companies like Apple indicated recently that it was shifting most of its production of iPhones headed to the US from China to India, trade analysts have cautioned that suchmanufacturing investment could yet stall, with the US and China agreeing to roll-back tariffs earlier this month.

Charlotte May Lee, 21, from south London, was arrested earlier this month after authorities allegedly found 46kg of cannabis in her suitcases when she arrived on a flight from Thailand. ""I can't compare it to anything,"" she said, adding she shares a cell with five other women and sleeps on a thin mattress on the concrete floor, using her clothes as a pillow. Ms Lee has not yet been charged, but has previously denied knowing the alleged drugs were in her luggage. If found guilty, she could face up to 25 years behind bars. The former flight attendant told the BBC she had travelled from Bangkok to Sri Lanka's capital Colombo to renew her Thai visa. She made a procedural court appearance on Friday while the investigation into her alleged offences continues. Speaking to the BBC before appearing in court, Ms Lee appeared to be in good spirits. She described her living conditions at a prison in Negombo, a city just north of the capital, saying she spends most of her day inside, although she does get to go outside for fresh air. ""I have never been to prison and I've never been to Sri Lanka,"" she said. ""This heat and just sitting on a concrete floor all of the time."" Ms Lee said she tries not to dwell too much on her current predicament. ""I am not trying to think about it. If I think, then I feel bad. I'll still rather not process it."" She said she is concerned for the other women who are also in prison. ""There are people from so many different countries who have been here for two years, two-and-a-half years. And it's still just waiting and no-one actually knows anything."" She has managed to find other English-speaking women with whom she has developed a kinship. But she has not been able to speak with her family since her arrest. Ms Lee arrived at Negombo Magistrate's Court on Friday wearing a white knee-length dress, her long hair parted to the side. She was held in a cell at the back of the courtroom before being brought to the witness box. She was visibly upset as she stood with her hands crossed behind her back, facing the magistrate. Authorities wheeled in a large brown box containing the alleged 46kg of cannabis found in Ms Lee's luggage. The narcotics division of the Sri Lanka police told the court they intend to file an update on the investigation. Ms Lee's lawyer, Sampath Perera, asked if the alleged drugs had been examined by the relevant government authorities to ascertain if the materials were in fact an illegal substance. The magistrate ordered it to be tested and for a report to be submitted to the court as soon as possible. Speaking to the BBC from outside the courthouse after the hearing, Mr Perera said the next step is to make a bail application for Ms Lee, which could take three months. Under Sri Lankan law, people being held on remand must appear before a judge every 14 days. Ms Lee is being held on suspicion of keeping illegal drugs in her possession and drug smuggling. Her next court appearance will be on 13 July. Additional reporting by Charlotte Scarr",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8nj885l87o,real

It comes after shares in the budget airline closed above €21 (£17.65) for a 28th consecutive day on Thursday, meeting a key performance target. Mr O'Leary will have the option to receive 10 million shares worth some €111.2m (£93.3m) providing he stays with the airline until the end of July 2028. The Irish boss, known for his punchy comments, said earlier this month that Ryanair was ""delivering exceptional value"" to shareholders despite it reporting a fall in full-year profits. ""I think Ryanair shareholders are getting a particular value out of our share options - both mine and the rest of the management team,"" he said in response to being asked about the share option on an analyst call earlier this month. ""We're delivering exceptional value for Ryanair shareholders in an era when premiership footballers or the managers are getting paid 20 to 25 million a year."" Ryanair said in a statement that the share price aspect of the bonus was ""on only one of two conditions"", adding: ""The second condition is that Michael and the rest of the management team must remain employed by Ryanair until the end of July 2028, so these share options won't vest for another three years yet."" Mr O'Leary has indicated that he could stay on longer at the airline when his current contract expires in 2028. He has been with Ryanair since 1988. Since becoming chief executive in 1994, He has spearheaded the airline's sharp trajectory from a relatively small regional airline into a Europe's largest low-cost carrier. ""There'll have to be some discussion I presume with the board as to how my remuneration will be fixed from 2028 onwards, if they want me to stay on after 2028,"" he said. The long-term incentive scheme for Mr O'Leary was first set out in 2019, the year he became group chief executive. But the High Pay Centre, a think tank which tracks executives' pay, criticised the bonus, saying ""regardless of how successful a business or how effective the company's leader is, no-one individual's contribution can ever be great enough to be worth a €100m bonus"". A statement added: ""This is especially true when most of Ryanair's employees - who also play a crucial role in the company's success - are unlikely to earn more than a fraction of that across their whole working lives."" Low-cost rival carrier, Wizz Air has a similar potential pay deal in place for its chief executive József Váradi. Mr Váradi stands to earn £100m if his airline's share price hits £120 by 2028. But Wizz Air has previously conceded that this was unlikely to be met with the shares trading well below that level.

The man had been linked to the death of Olorato Mongale, whose body was found in Johannesburg on Sunday, about two hours after she was reported missing having gone on a date. In the early hours of Friday morning, police officers found the main suspect hiding at a residential complex in the coastal town of Amanzimtoti, police spokesperson Athlenda Mathe said. The suspect, who has not been named by the police, shot at the officers, who returned fire and killed him, Brigadier Mathe added. Regional police commissioner Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi said that at the time of the suspect's death, he had 28 ID cards and a dozen mobile phones in his possession. After hearing of the fatal shootout, Chriselda Kananda, a spokesperson for Ms Mongale's family, told South African broadcaster SABC News: ""It is quite a relief for the family that justice for Olorato, before we even lay her body to rest, would have been served."" Ms Mongale's death has sparked a fierce debate about the levels of violence faced by women in South Africa. The country has one of the highest rates of femicide and gender-based violence in the world. In an impassioned statement, Police Minister Senzo Mchunu called Ms Mongale's killing ""inhumane"" and ""gruesome"", adding: ""To all men, this is a plea - simple, urgent, and human: Please, stop killing women."" While continuing the search for two other men allegedly linked to the murder, the police took the parents of the deceased suspect into custody. The suspect's mother is accused of enabling him to ""evade arrest"" by tipping him off about the police's presence at her house. The police also said the suspect's father is the owner of a VW Polo allegedly used in Ms Mongale's murder. The vehicle, which has been seized by the police, had traces of blood inside it, Brig Mathe said. The suspect's parents were questioned in custody but have now been released, said commissioner Mkhwanazi. Earlier this week, the police named the three suspects linked to the killing as Fezile Ngubane, Philangenkosi Sibongokuhle Makhanya and Bongani Mthimkhulu. Two of them - Mr Makhanya and Mr Mthimkhulu - were last month arrested for kidnapping and robbing a woman in KwaZulu-Natal, using the same VW Polo involved in Ms Mongale's murder, police said. Both men had been freed on bail. As part of their investigation into the killing, the police have identified a criminal gang or ""syndicate"" who have been targeting women in malls ""for kidnapping and robbery"", said police spokesperson Mathe. ""They propose them, request to take them out on a date. When they agree, that is when they plan to rob them,"" she added. When Ms Mongale was last seen on Sunday, she was on a date with a man she had met a few days earlier at a shopping centre. CCTV footage showed her leaving a location in Kew, Johannesburg, and walking towards a white VW Polo with fake licence plates. The 30-year-old's friends said she was invited for a date by a man only identified as John, who she had met in Johannesburg, where she was studying for a postgraduate degree at Witwatersrand University. She texted one of her friends shortly before leaving home, saying that she was excited and getting ready for her date. But police later found her body in an open field, sparking public outrage and calls for justice. The family spokesperson said Ms Mongale's body had been ""brutally violated"". A candlelight vigil was held on Wednesday evening in Lombardy West, at the site where her body was found. Family and friends have described her as an outspoken, bubbly woman who ""lived with purpose and love"", local media reported. Go toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.

However, growth for full 2024-25 year, which runs between April and March, is pegged at 6.5% - the slowest in four years. The country's central bank - the Reserve Bank of India - meets later in June and is expected to cut rates for the third time in a row to boost growth. India remains the world's fastest growing major economy, although growth has sharply dropped from the 9.2% high recorded in financial year 2023-24. Asia's third-largest economy benefitted from strong farm activity, steady public spending and improved rural demand in the last financial year, even as manufacturing and new investments by private companies remained weak. While rural growth has improved on account of a strong winter harvest, it is not nearly enough to offset continuing weakness in urban consumption, which has flagged due to high unemployment and lower wages. India's growth engine remains heavily dependent on the government's infrastructure spending on roads, ports and highways, in the absence of significant improvement in private investment. Going forward, domestic growth should benefit from government's income tax cuts announced in the federal budget, as well as ""monetary easing, expectations of an above normal monsoon and lower food inflation"", Aditi Nayar, an economist with the ratings agency Icra, said. But ongoing global uncertainties, including US President Donald Trump's trade war, are expected to weigh on export demand. India is currently negotiating a trade-agreement with the United States which is officially expected to conclude by fall. Trump slapped tariffs of up to 27% on Indian goods in April – and a 90-day pause on these ends on 9 July. Economists expect GDP growth in the ongoing financial year 2025-26  to further slow to 6% on the back of these global slowdown worries which could delay new private capital spending on projects. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects global growth to drop to 2.8% in 2025 and 3% in 2026. Data from Icra earlier showed private sector expenditure, as part of overall investments in India's economy, fell to a 10-year low of 33% in the last financial year. Net foreign direct investment (FDI) into India – at $0.35bn in 2024-25 – also fell to the lowest level in two decades, as rising outward foreign investment and repatriations by Indian companies, neutralised inward investment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has been attempting to position India as a manufacturing hub for global companies. While companies like Apple indicated recently that it was shifting most of its production of iPhones headed to the US from China to India, trade analysts have cautioned that suchmanufacturing investment could yet stall, with the US and China agreeing to roll-back tariffs earlier this month.

Earlier this week, the South African-born billionaire, on his social media platform, X, thanked President Trump for histime at the Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge. Trump announced he will host a news conference in the Oval Office on Friday with Musk, writing: ""This will be his last day, but not really, because he will, always, be with us, helping all the way."" While Musk's time in government lasted little more than four months, his work with Doge upended the federal government and had an impact not just in the halls of power in Washington - but around the world. Let's take a look at some of the ways Musk has left a mark. Musk took a job with the Trump White House with one mission: to cut spending from the government as much as possible. He began with an initial target of ""at least $2 trillion"", which then shifted to $1tn and ultimately $150bn. To date, Doge claims to have saved $175bn through a combination of asset sales, lease and grant cancellations, ""fraud and improper payment deletion"", regulatory savings and a 260,000-person reduction from the 2.3 million-strong federal workforce. ABBC analysis of those figures,however, found that evidence is sometimes lacking. This mission has at times caused both chaos and controversy, including some instances in which federal judges halted mass firings and ordered employees reinstated. In other instances, the administration has been forced to backtrack on firings. In one notable instance in February, the administration stopped the firing of hundreds of federal employees working at the National Nuclear Security Administration, including some with sensitive jobs related to the US nuclear arsenal. Musk himself repeatedly acknowledged that mass firings would inevitably include mistakes. ""We will make mistakes,"" he said in February, after his department mistook a region of Mozambique for Hamas-controlled Gaza while cutting an aid programme. ""But we'll act quickly to correct any mistakes."" Doge's efforts to access data also garnered controversy, particularly the department's push for access to sensitive treasury department systems that control the private information of millions of Americans. Polls show that cuts to government spending remain popular with many Americans - even if Musk's personal popularity has waned. The presence of Musk - an unelected ""special government employee"" with companies that count the US government as customers - in Trump's White House has also raised eyebrows, prompting questions about potential conflicts of interest. His corporate empire includes large companies that do business with US and foreign governments. SpaceX has $22 billion in US government contracts, according to the company's chief executive. Some Democrats also accused Musk of taking advantage of his position to drum up business abroad for his satellite internet services firm, Starlink. The White House was accused of helping Musk's businesses by showcasing vehicles made by Tesla - his embattled car company - on the White House lawn in March. Musk and Trump have both shrugged off any suggestion that his work with the government is conflicted or ethically problematic. Around the world, Musk's work with Doge was most felt after the vast majority - over 80% - of the US Agency for International Development's (USAID's) programmes were eliminated following a six-week review by Doge. The rest were absorbed by the State Department. The Musk and Doge-led cuts formed part of a wider effort by the Trump administration to bring overseas spending closer in line with its ""America First"" approach. The cuts to the agency - tasked with work such as famine detection, vaccinations and food aid in conflict areas - quickly had an impact on projects includingcommunal kitchens in war-torn Sudan, scholarshipsfor young Afghan womenwho fled the Taliban and clinicsfor transgender people in India. USAID also was a crucial instrument of US ""soft power"" around the world, leading some detractors pointing to its elimination as a sign of waning American influence on the global stage. While Musk - and Trump - have for years been accused by detractors of spreading baseless conspiracy theories, Musk's presence in the White House starkly highlighted how misinformation has crept into discourse at the highest levels of the US government. For example, Musk spread an unfounded internet theory that US gold reserves had quietly been stolen from Fort Knox in Kentucky. At one point, he floated the idea of livestreaming a visit there to ensure the gold was secured. More recently,Musk spread widely discredited rumours that the white Afrikaner population of South Africa is facing ""genocide"" in their home country. Those rumours found their way into the Oval Office earlier in May, when a meeting aimed at soothing tensions between the US and South Africa took a drastic twist after Trump presented South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with videos and articles he said were evidence of crimes against Afrikaners. Musk's work in government also showed that, despite public pledges of unity, there are tensions within the ""Trump 2.0"" administration. While Trump publicly - and repeatedly - backed the work of Musk and Doge, Musk's tenure was marked by reports of tension between him and members of the cabinet who felt Doge cuts were impacting their agencies. ""They have a lot of respect for Elon and that he's doing this, and some disagree a little bit,"" Trump acknowledged in a February cabinet meeting. ""If they aren't, I want them to speak up."" At one point, he was asked whether any cabinet members had expressed dissatisfaction with Musk and turned to the room to ask them. No one spoke. The announcement of Musk's departure also came the same day that CBS - the BBC's US partner - publicised part of an interview during which Musk said he was""disappointed"" by Trump's ""big, beautiful"" budget bill.The bill includes multi-trillion dollar tax breaks and a pledge to increase defence spending. Musk said the bill ""undermines"" the work of Doge to cut spending - reflecting larger tensions within the Republican Party over the path forward. The remarks from both sides raise concerns that a trade war could erupt again between the two largest economies. The ruling means 530,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela are at risk of being deported. Kerik, who pleaded guilty to fraud in 2009 and was later pardoned by Trump, died after a ""private battle with illness"".

He is also charged with indecently assaulting a woman by grabbing her arm and dragging her towards a male toilet in 2001, and with sexually assaulting a different woman by kissing and groping her in 2004 or 2005. Mr Brand did not speak to reporters and looked straight ahead as he entered the court building wearing a dark suit and unbuttoned shirt. He stood in the glass dock as he spoke to confirm his name, and replied ""not guilty"" after each of the counts were put to him. He then put his sunglasses back on as he walked out of the dock, thanking the usher as he left. Leaving the building shortly afterwards, he was flanked by security guards as he walked past photographers and camera crews to a waiting car. The media personality and influencer, of Hambleden, Buckinghamshire, will remain on conditional bail until the trial. A pre-trial review has been scheduled for 20 May 2026. After being charged in April, he released a video saying he was not a rapist and had never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity. ""I'm now going to have the opportunity to defend these charges in court and I'm incredibly grateful for that,"" he told followers at the time. Mr Brand, who was born in Essex, rose to fame as a stand-up comedian and became a household name as host of TV shows like Big Brother's Big Mouth, and with his own radio programmes on stations including BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music. He went on to establish a Hollywood career, starring in films like Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him To The Greek.
