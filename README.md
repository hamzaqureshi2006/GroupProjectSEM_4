üéì Project Report: MultiMediaPlatform
‚úÖ 1. Introduction
In today‚Äôs digital era, multimedia platforms play a vital role in information sharing, learning, and entertainment. However, challenges such as fake news, information overload, and spam comments reduce user trust and experience. Our project ‚ÄúMultiMediaPlatform‚Äù aims to create a unified social media and news platform that integrates AI/ML capabilities to solve these issues efficiently.

‚úÖ 2. Team Structure and Roles
Our project is developed by a team of five students, with distributed responsibilities:

Member	Role
Member 0 (Myself)	Backend API Development, Article Summarization, Recommendation System
Member 1	Backend Development, Fake News Detection
Member 2	Frontend Development, Testing, Documentation
Member 3	Frontend Development, UI/UX Design, Spam Comments Detection
Member 4	Fake News Detection, Recommendation System

‚úÖ 3. Problem Statement
Fake news and misinformation are widely shared on social media, impacting public perception.

Spam comments reduce meaningful interactions.

Long articles or lectures are difficult to revise quickly.

Video recommendations are often irrelevant without personalisation.

‚úÖ 4. Proposed Solution
Our platform integrates:

Video sharing features for general users and creators.

News articles with AI summarisation, allowing quick learning.

Fake news detection models to mark unreliable content.

Spam comment detection for cleaner interactions.

Personalised video recommendations using clustering-based ML models.

‚úÖ 5. Technology Stack
Module	Technology Used	Justification
Frontend	React.js, CSS, Bootstrap	Component-based architecture, fast rendering, responsiveness
Backend	Express.js + MongoDB Atlas	Lightweight, scalable, cloud database for videos and users
AI/ML Features	Django + Python ML Libraries	Leverages Python ecosystem for NLP and ML tasks efficiently

‚úÖ 6. Features Implemented
‚úîÔ∏è User Registration/Login: Secure authentication using JWT.
‚úîÔ∏è Video Upload: Users can upload videos with thumbnails, stored on Cloudinary.
‚úîÔ∏è Video CRUD APIs: APIs to create, read, update, and delete videos efficiently.

‚úÖ 7. AI/ML Features
We integrate four AI/ML modules to enhance user experience:

Feature	Description	Implemented By
Article Summarisation	Uses NLP summarisation models (e.g. T5, BART) to summarise long articles for quick reading.	Member 0
Fake News Detection	Classifies news articles as real or fake using pretrained models and custom fine-tuning.	Members 1 & 4
Spam Comments Detection	Detects promotional, generic, irrelevant, or malicious comments to maintain clean discussions.	Member 3
Recommendation System	Uses user and video clustering to recommend relevant videos to each user.	Members 0 & 4

‚úÖ 8. Database Design
MongoDB Atlas Cloud Database
Collections:

Users

Videos

Comments

News Articles

‚úÖ 9. Recommendation System Approach
Our recommendation module clusters:

Users: Based on likes, views, subscriptions.

Videos: Based on category, tags, engagement metrics.

Creators: Based on publishing trends and user clusters.

If User A likes a video, other users in the same cluster are recommended similar videos, enhancing personalisation.

‚úÖ 10. Unique Selling Points (USP)
‚úîÔ∏è Article Summarisation for fast learning and revision
‚úîÔ∏è Fake News Detection to build user trust
‚úîÔ∏è Spam Comments Detection for cleaner interactions
‚úîÔ∏è Recommendation System tailored to user clusters

‚úÖ 11. Target Audience
Students revising from article summaries and watching learning videos

News readers verifying news credibility

General users seeking an integrated multimedia and knowledge platform

‚úÖ 12. Challenges Faced
Integrating Python Django ML APIs with MERN backend efficiently

Designing a scalable architecture to merge multiple backends using NGINX

Ensuring clean and intuitive UI/UX for multiple features

Time management with complex AI/ML models and web development tasks

‚úÖ 13. Future Scope
Video Summarisation: Automatic summarisation of uploaded lectures or tutorials.

Quiz Generation: Generate conceptual quizzes from summarised articles for self-assessment.

‚úÖ 14. Conclusion
Our MultiMediaPlatform is a scalable, AI-integrated social media and news platform with innovative features to tackle misinformation, spam, and information overload. It enhances learning, ensures credible news consumption, and delivers personalised video recommendations, aiming to create a trusted, knowledge-driven multimedia community.
